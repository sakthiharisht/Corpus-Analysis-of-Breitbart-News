This figure does not include those who were able to enter the country undetected, but only those who were officially registered either by Italian officials or NGOs.


Of these, only 4,808 were recognized as refugees and awarded asylum in Italy, a mere 2.65 percent of the total number of those making the crossing.
A disturbing statistic that has recently come to light reveals that half of the migrants arriving in the country (90,334) never even requested asylum, but disappeared into the country as undocumented immigrants, commonly referred to by the Italians as “clandestini.”
The remaining 91,902 migrants applied for asylum, and 60 percent of these (54,252) had their petitions rejected unconditionally. Another 21 percent (18,979) were awarded “humanitarian protection,” allowing them a renewable yearly permission to remain in the country, and 14 percent more (12,873) were given “subsidiary protection.”

The 4,808 immigrants who were awarded asylum represent 5.28 percent of the asylum seekers and therefore only 2.65 percent of the total number of immigrants entering in the country during the year.
Despite the fact that the vast majority of immigrants into Italy were denied asylum, fewer than 5,000 were deported in 2016, meaning that more than 175,000 remained in the country, most of them illegally.
Despite last year’s record immigration into Italy, the first quarter of 2017 registered a 30 percent jump compared with the same period in 2016. Shortly afterward, Italy received another 8,500 migrants in a single weekend as migrants poured into the country over Easter.
The leader of the Northern League (La Lega) political party, Matteo Salvini, announced that he would bring a case against government leaders for promotion of illegal immigration into the country.
“It is now clear that illegal immigration is organized and financed and for this reason we have decided to bring a case against the government, the President of the Council, the ministers and the commanders of the Navy and the Coast Guard,” Salvini said.

With new Home Secretary Sajid Javid relaxing immigration controls, it is unlikely the target will ever be met — lending further credence to former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne’s claims that the Tories never seriously intended to bring immigration down.

Commenting, Chairman of Migration Watch UK Lord Green of Deddington said: “These are very disappointing figures. Migration from the EU is still adding 100,000 a year to our population and non-EU net migration is the highest level in a calendar year for 13 years. It’s time for the Government to get serious about reducing immigration instead of caving into every demand of the immigration lobby.”

Claims of a supposed ‘Brexodus’ of EU migrants from the United Kingdom since the people voted to Leave the European Union in June 2016 are common in the mainstream media, but as the ONS itself notes: “Much has been written about EU citizens leaving the UK, but the fact is there are still more people coming to the country from the EU than leaving it. In fact, the last quarter shows that around 100,000 more EU citizens are coming to the UK than leaving.”
In fact, Migration Watch believes the true figures for EU immigration could actually be far higher than the ONS figures — based on traveller surveys which some critics have derided as “little more than guesswork” — as there is a significant discrepancy between immigration estimates and population growth estimates.
Migration Watch co-chairman Alp Mehmet said the difference worked out at around 508,000 – roughly equivalent to the population of Sheffield, Britain’s fourth-largest city.
“Our paper suggests that Brexit could be an even more effective means of reducing immigration than previously thought,” he added hopefully.
“This underlines the importance of taking a firm line, so far absent, on lower-skilled migration from the EU.”

Greece last year was the first EU port of entry for migrants and has struggled to manage the influx, with many kept in overcrowded camps on the Aegean Greek islands near the Turkish coast.


“The asylum we grant has a duration of three years, it is not indefinite,” Mitarachi told To Vima weekly.
“If conditions change in a country [of origin], asylum may not be renewed,” Mitarachi added.
“It is difficult to integrate different populations,” he said.

More than 36,000 asylum-seekers are currently crammed into camps on five islands, where the official capacity is for 6,200 people and in conditions repeatedly condemned by aid agencies.
Overpopulation in migrant camps on Lesbos and other islands near Turkey has led to an outpouring of anger in recent days among island residents and asylum-seekers.
Since the migration crisis erupted in 2015, mainly fuelled by the war in Syria, Greece has granted asylum to around 40,000 people, Mitarachi said.
Another 87,000 asylum applications are pending, he added.


Repatriation of asylum seekers whose applications are rejected are to be discussed in an overhaul of EU migration policy next month, the minister said.
“Joint return operations will figure prominently in the new European Commission proposals expected in March and April,” Mitarachi said.
The new government has introduced stricter asylum rules, and last month put out a call for a floating barrier in the Aegean to stop migrant boats.
The system — criticised as unethical and impractical by rights groups and opposition parties — could involve either barriers or nets, 2.7 kilometres (1.7 miles) long, and would be used as an emergency measure by the Greek armed forces.
Mitarachi on Sunday said the barrier project would be given a “tryout” and implemented only if deemed effective.

A self-anointed international human rights court, the PPT was established in Bologna, Italy, in 1979, inspired by the Russell Tribunal, led by philosophers Bertrand Russell and Jean-Paul Sartre against alleged war crimes committed in Vietnam.
The European Union and its Member States have subjected refugees and migrants to “the most heinous and systematic violations of their fundamental rights (to life, to dignity, to work, to health, to seek a future…),” the text states, “in an environment of total impunity of the responsible actors.”
The nine-page document states that “what is often called a migrant crisis is, in reality, a profound crisis within the European Union which has been shown to have arisen in every country of the Union in one way or another.”

The right to migrate is “being denied to the people migrating from the global South to the global North,” it declares, and the right to come and go along with the right to work “are in reality being denied by closing Europe’s borders.”
European states are failing in their “duty to receive migrants” in the name of affirming “State sovereignty over their territorial domain,” it states. “This policy of closing Europe’s borders, whose prosperity has been created based on an economic system of plundering the resources of the global South cannot be considered legitimate or politically justifiable.”
Curiously, the PPT blames tighter border security for migrant sea deaths, while failing to acknowledge that sea deaths in the Mediterranean dropped by more than half after Italy closed its ports and discouraged migrants from attempting the perilous crossing.
No single factor has been more effective at saving the lives of migrants from death at sea, in fact, than the closing of Italy’s ports.
In its most recent report on migrant deaths and disappearances in the Mediterranean Sea, the United Nations immigration office (UNHCR) found that migrant sea deaths in 2019 were less than half (207) those recorded in 2018 during the same period (433).

On reading the PPT declaration, one could be tempted to conclude that the authors’ main interest is not in fact in saving the lives of migrants but in encouraging mass migration and eliminating any attempts at reining it in.
“Banning and pushing back the NGO ships from the Mediterranean, which has also been imposed by the Italian government’s mandatory ‘code of conduct,’ has considerably weakened the migrant search and rescue operations at sea and increased the number of victims,” the text states, an assertion that is verifiably false.
The PPT seems to take for granted that European sovereign nation-states have no right to determine who crosses their borders, without the consent of the European Parliament.
“It is illegal to transform Europe into a fortress by closing ports and borders and refusing to rescue and assist those in need, because it violates binding International law and is unlawful because adopted using measures issued without any discussion and approval of the European Parliament and the national Parliaments,” the declaration asserts.

The 63-year-old prime minister is a confirmed nationalist and an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, and has pursued a “Japan-first” economic policy that has been compared to that of Mr. Trump.
The admiration seems to be mutual, and the two leaders spent a fair amount of time together during Trump’s Asia trip earlier this month. “Our relationship is really extraordinary,” Mr. Trump said. “We like each other and our countries like each other. And I don’t think we’ve ever been closer to Japan than we are right now.”
Japan is an ethnically homogeneous nation, with less than 2 percent of the population foreign born, and its immigration policies are designed to defend Japan’s cultural identity as well as to insure national security. It also aims to protect the local job market to keep unemployment to a minimum.

Tokyo has claimed that many people seek asylum in Japan in order to find work, since people applying for refugee status have access to renewable work permits.
According to Japanese immigration policy, unskilled migrant workers are denied entry. Five years ago, Japan introduced a points-based immigration system to “promote entry of highly-skilled foreign professionals” in order to insure that migrants were making a positive contribution to the country.
Earlier this month, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) pressed Japan to accept more refugees when it came to light that the country had only accepted only 3 refugees during the entire first half of 2017. In 2016, Japan took in a total of just 28 refugees in the whole calendar year, out of 10,901 applicants for asylum.
At a press conference in Tokyo, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi complained that Japan wasn’t doing its part to welcome migrants and refugees.
“That program is very small, about 20-30 refugees a year,” Mr. Grandi said. “I have asked the government to consider whether it could be expanded.”
Despite its unwillingness to take in more migrants, Tokyo has pledged $18.6 million in humanitarian aid to assist in the Rohingya crisis, which UN officials have denounced as a “classic example of ethnic cleansing.” Japan is currently the fourth largest donor to the UNHCR.
According to the Global Peace Index for 2017, Japan is ranked as the tenth safest country in the world, with a “very high” state of peace.

Migrants from Africa arrive in Italy on a rescue ship


In October of last year, France finally demolished the refugee camp known as “The Jungle.” It was populated by about 7,000 migrants who came there hoping to reach Britain, where they could apply for asylum. When the camp was demolished, they were given the choice of either being deported back to their home countries or of staying in some 300 temporary refugee centers across France, where they can apply for asylum.
However, many of them left Calais on their own, and went to the Grande-Synthe refugee camp in Dunkirk, which became known as “the New Jungle.” The camp had been built by Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), and included hundreds of wooden huts. The camp opened in March 2016 as the first camp in France to meet international humanitarian standards, where migrant families could live in relatively dignified conditions in heated wooden cabins.
The Dunkirk camp had a capacity of 700 and was severely overcrowded, eventually housing 1,600. Furthermore, many of the new arrivals from The Jungle, who were mostly Afghans, did not get along with the original migrants, who were mostly Iraqi and Kurdish. There were multiple fights between groups of migrants of different nationalities, with some 600 migrants taking part in the fighting. In March of this year, the Grande-Synthe refugee camp, including all the wooden huts, burnt to the ground, leaving nothing but ashes. According to French officials, multiple fires must have been set on purpose.

So now, three months later, it is June, the weather is great, and hundreds of migrants are flooding back into Calais. Officials are refusing to build a proposed reception center for asylum-seekers to Calais, saying that it would only encourage more people to come.
According to France’s Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, part of the government of the new president Emmanuel Macron:
We’ve seen this before, it starts with a few hundred people and ends with several thousand people who we can’t manage. That’s why we don’t want a center here.
Humanitarian non-government organizations (NGOs) are trying to feed the 400-600 migrants currently “living rough” in Calais, but complain that they are being harassed by Calais police. So 11 NGOs sued the local authorities, saying that they have “prevented” the distribution of food to hundreds of migrants.
The court rejected the request to set up a new emergency center to shelter migrants in Calais but also ruled that the migrants should be allowed to receive humanitarian add. Furthermore, judges ordered officials, within 10 days, to establish several drinking fountains, toilets, and showers for migrants who are “exposed to inhuman and degrading conditions” in the area. The judge said, “It is not possible to leave these people, who are in a state of complete destitution without any aid.” AFP (23-June) and France 24 and The Local (France)

Italy begs for help after 12,000 migrants arrive in four days
Italy has threatened to close all of its ports to ships of foreign NGOs carrying migrants and refugees, after being overwhelmed by the arrival of 12,000 migrants in four days on 22 ships. The UN Migration Agency said 8,863 migrants were rescued trying to reach Italy from Libya, and the EU’s border agency Frontex said its boats had recovered an additional 2,700 people.
About 76,000 migrants have arrived since January, and some estimates say that 220,000 people could land in Italy by the end of 2017.

The ships cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya and mostly contain African refugees. In one Italian port in Reggio Calabria alone, 1,066 people disembarked from the Save the Children rescue ship Vos Hestia on Thursday. Among them were 241 unaccompanied minors.
According to a European Council official:
In recent years people smugglers have launched massive numbers at the same time. But this year we are witnessing levels never registered before in such short periods of time.
Loss of life and continuing migratory flows of primarily economic migrants on the central Mediterranean route is a structural challenge and remains an issue of urgent and serious concern.
The EU and its member states must restore control to avoid a worsening humanitarian crisis.
Italy agrees that the EU must restore control. Italy says that it is unable to cope with this year’s expected flood of refugees, and is demanding help from the European Union, or else it will close all its ports to ships carrying migrants. Since the rescue operations do not take place in Italian waters, Italy is under no obligation under international law to take the refugees in, according to some experts. Analysts say that this would be a humanitarian catastrophe because the ships would have to be diverted to other countries, for which they have inadequate provisions.

One of the NGOs operating rescue boats said that it understood the pressure that Italy was under, but:
However, we also believe that closing the ports of safety to people seeking refuge from war, violence and poverty cannot be the solution. We would like to stress again that NGOs are not the cause, nor the solution to this humanitarian crisis. Without our presence at sea, even more people would die.
The kind of help that Italy would like is that refugees arriving in Italy should be distributed to other European countries, but there isn’t a snowflake’s chance in hell that will happen. In 2015, the EU agreed that 160,000 asylum seekers should be relocated from Greece and Italy to other member states, in the name of burden-sharing. To date, only about 22,500 of the 160,000 have actually been transferred. Several central and eastern European EU members – including large countries like Hungary and Poland – have absolutely refused to take in any asylum-seekers.
However, some EU officials are offering Italy financial aid.
Italy’s threat may be based in politics, in the wake of a Sunday local election rout for the ruling center-left Democratic Party, which several commentators blamed on public discontent with rising immigration and government proposals to grant citizenship to children of foreign residents. The opposition Forza Italia party of former premier Silvio Berlusconi – seen as one of the winners of the local elections – said the government had responded to its urgings for a tougher line on migration.

Migrants from countries like Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria are said to be numerous among the other nationalities gathered at the border after the Turkish government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the gates to Europe.


French broadcaster BFMTV spoke to a group of Moroccan migrants at the border in Edirne who claimed they were not seeking asylum but rather were looking for money and better job prospects in Europe.

“We saw on Whatsapp and Facebook messages that say the doors are open between Turkey and Greece,” one of the Moroccans said and added: “So we came to try to go to France, or to Germany. We have nothing in Morocco, no work, no money, I don’t want to stay at home doing nothing.”

Another Moroccan, named Samir, said that he had been injured by Greek border guards but said that he would try and storm the border again saying: “Even if it costs my life.”
The reportage from the French publication comes as the Greek government claimed that just four per cent of the ‘refugees’ that had breached the border so far were Syrians, with Afghans being the largest group at 64 per cent. Even Turks fleeing Turkey were a larger group than Syrians at 5 per cent.
During the height of the migrant crisis in 2015 many of those coming into Europe, particularly to Germany, were revealed to be North Africans.
While most North Africans have their asylum claims rejected, as most come from countries that are already deemed to be safe, few who are rejected in Germany are actually deported.
A 2017 report from the German government claimed that of the 8,363 migrants from North Africa who were rejected for asylum claims, just 368 were actually deported in 2016.
North African asylum seekers have also been overrepresented in crime in many countries such as the Netherlands where one in five is recently suspected of participation in crime, according to a 2018 report.

Focusing on migrants is now a staple tactic of the Islamist terror groups Islamic State, the Taliban, al-Qaida, al-Shabaab and Boko Haram, as all five organisation mentioned ‘refugees’ every day in their online material between June 13th 2016 and January 8th 2017, analysis found.
In the same period, researchers found 263 instances of such groups attempting to convince individual refugees to wage jihad against non-believers or join extremists and convert to Islam.
The report discusses certain “hotspots” on migration routes where Islamic State terrorists are frequently engaging with refugees and migrants.

The south Libyan town of Qatrun is mentioned, where Islamic State is believed to have between 4,000 to 6,000 fighters, and jihadists have reportedly funded the £450 smuggler fees for migrants to travel north, towards Europe, if they joined the terror group.
The report explains that youngsters travelling alone are particularly vulnerable to radicalization by jihadist groups. The European Union’s police agency Europol has identified an estimated 88,300 unaccompanied young migrants who have gone missing and are open to being targeted in this way.
Nikita Malik, a senior researcher at Quilliam, said: “Young asylum seekers are targeted by extremist groups as they are more vulnerable to indoctrination, make able fighters and, in the case of girls, can create a new generation of recruits.
“This report outlines national and international requirements to reduce the risk of child-trafficking, extremism and modern slavery.”
The report said: “Young unaccompanied refugees are more vulnerable to radicalisation if they are separated from their parents, who remained in the country of origin at risk to violent and radical groups, or in a new host country.
“There is no question that militant groups target refugee youth for recruitment. It has also been argued that refugee youth can become autonomously radicalised, through online content, for example.”",5-Feb-17

LISTEN:


1 – Close the Border
Vaughan said the executive branch  “needs to do something in the short-term,” including consideration of shutting down crossings through the U.S.-Mexico border.

Vaughan stated, “If it gets to the point where [caravan migrants] get to the U.S. border in a group like that, which they may not, they could be broken up. Some of them are going to get to the U.S. border, for sure, because there’s just no way Mexico is going to find all those people who busted through that fence … and they may not come as a caravan, they’ll just try to cross illegally.”
Vaughan recalled how the U.S. essentially shut down the southern border in 1985 after Mexican drug cartel criminals murdered Enrique “Kiki” Camarena, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent.
Vaughan remarked, “But if they come as a group we could shut down a border crossing or shut down a part of the border. It’s been done before in order to shut down drug trafficking and make a statement. When a DEA agent was killed in Mexico, we shut down the order to make a statement. … It could be done. … That might be what it comes to, and I don’t think Mexico wants to see that.”
2 – Refuse Bogus Asylum Claims
Mansour noted the economic reasons for caravaning migrants seeking entry to the U.S.: “The media is not even trying to pretend that these people are fleeing for anything other than economic reasons.”

News media outlets such as the New York Times and Washington Post have described caravaning migrants’ motivations for seeking entry to the U.S. as economic.
Vaughan described the openly stated economic motivations of the caravaning migrants as “[making] it harder to justify allowing these people to set foot in the United States.”

Vaughan recalled how left-wing lawyers had previously coached foreigners — providing them specific scripts to recite before border security and immigration officials — on how best to enter America via existing refugee and asylum laws and policies.
Left-wing lawyers have also previously provided pro bono legal services to asylum claimants who had entered U.S. territory.
Vaughan said, “Back on the open borders crowd, I don’t think this open admission that this is economic migration is going to stop the left from trying to rationalize their wish for us to let them all in, and they want a scene at the border where the U.S. government looks like they’re being brutal and mean to desperate migrants. They think that works for them.”

Vaughan continued, “I disagree that that’s how it plays out with American voters, but they still think this is something we should just give in to, and I think they’re still going to try to justify it in their minds and make the case, just like they did with the whole family separation issue.”
Vaughan concluded, “The president is going to have to do what is necessary, and not worry about what the New York Times thinks.”
3 – Refuse Entry to Migrants and Send Them Home
Vaughan said, “I think that the caravan itself is going to be broken up, but many of the people in it are going to make their way up to the order and try to get across, and many of them are going to succeed. “
Vaughan continued, “If they come in a big group like that, they could well shut down the border, but I have a feeling that we’re going to see it break up and people end up getting through individually, anyway, unless the president takes more bold steps to say, ‘Look, I’m stopping this. These people aren’t getting through. We’re not accepting their asylum claims, because they’re bogus.'”
Vaughan added, “[Trump must] actually send them back. That’s what it’s going to take to avoid having more of these caravans. These are not credible fear claims that are credible. They don’t meet the standard of the law, and therefore they’re going home and we’re not even going to allow them in as others have. It’s over. That’s what it’s going to take.”
Vaughan advised Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen against reliance on Congressional passage of legislation to assist DHS’s mandate to secure the homeland.
“The executive branch needs to do something in the short-term,” declared Vaughan.
“Can troops be sent down there to protect the border?” asked Mansour.
Vaughan replied, “Most people believe that they can only be used to support immigration officers like the border patrol [and] that they can’t be used to actually make immigration arrests, but there is a provision in the law that allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to deputize state and local law enforcement to assist with border security, so that’s a possibility, if it gets out hand.”
Vaughan added, “I could see Texas wanting to provide support to the border patrol. They do that already at the expense of Texas. I think there will be reinforcements who arrive if it looks like another scene like we just saw play out in Mexico.”
4 – Mandate Asylum Claims be Made in Consulates or Embassies in Home Countries, Not U.S. Ports of Entry
Both Vaughan and Mansour said migrants seeking asylum should file their claims at consulates or embassies within their own countries, not at U.S. ports of entry.
“The administration basically has to say — I don’t know if they can do this — but make a ruling saying, ‘If you want to request asylum, you need to request it at the embassy in your country,'” said Mansour, asking, “Why don’t they just request it at the consulate or embassy and not even come here?”
Vaughan agreed, adding, “Exactly, and it would still be fair. We could still accept any bona fide cases, but we don’t have them crashing the border, and we don’t have this this farce kangaroo court immigration process.”
Vaughan also recommended denying the caravaning migrants entry to the U.S. and having them wait in Mexico while federal authorities process their anticipated asylum claims.
Illegal aliens often fail to appear before immigration judges once admitted to the U.S. and issued a court date.
Vaughan highlighted Mexico’s negligence in allowing migrants — many of whom are seeking passage to the U.S. — to illegally enter its territory through its southern border.
Vaughan said of Mexican authorities: “When they want to enforce their immigration laws, they do it pretty strictly with behavior that would never be tolerated against Mexicans in the United States.”
Mexican authorities could intercept migrants seeking entry to the U.S. on a transnational train nicknamed, “The Beast.”
“These people are going to be headed for The Beast, that train that heads up through Mexico to the U.S. border,” said Vaughan, “They can stop it there. They can stop a lot of people there.”
“Border crashers” cannot be considered “peaceful asylum seekers,” added Vaughan.
Asylum claims from migrants seeking entry to the U.S. via Mexico should not be considered unless their asylum requests are submitted at consulates or embassies in their home countries or in Mexico, said Vaughan.
In April, Vaughan said, “we have to be firm. We can also tell people that they can apply for asylum in our consulate in Tijuana. We have a branch of the U.S. embassy there and they could wait there while their claim is adjudicated. We can take a couple of weeks to hear their case from our consulate in Tijuana, or Mexico City or anywhere else in the country of Mexico; save them a long journey.”

So we remphasize to our officers that they need to check and see if people [asking for asylum] attempted to relocate internally. And [officials] need to check and see with the information they have available what internal relocation options exist for each applicant.

“Let me clarify that it’s not a new policy,” he told Breitbart News. “This is my efforts to harness the information we have available and provide it to our officers and remind them of various requirements of the regulations.”
The opposition from migration advocates has been muted, so far. But many asylum officers in USCIS may quietly oppose the policy, in part, because they prefer to provide migrants with green cards. 
The new policy is just one of numerous small, medium, and large steps that are being undertaken by border officials to combat the huge migration of almost 800,000 migrants in only nine months. The migrants come mostly from Central America but are also arriving from South America, African and Asia, and India. 

The administration’s “broad strategy” comes after progressive lawyers and pro-migration judges have temporarily blocked many of the major policies announced by the administration, including policies to end the DACA amnesty, build the wall, detain migrants, and tighten asylum rules. 
The revived focus on internal migration already paid off when asylum offices faced a wave of asylum requests from people in the chaotically diverse country of India. 
State Department officials have gathered much information about internal conflicts and safe zones for various population groups in India.  Amid growing requests for asylum, “when that level of detail became available … and our officers were introduced to the information and trained up on it, there was a very distinct change in outcomes,” he said. The outcome numbers “literally flipped … because of the availability of so many internal relocation options for Indians.”
The same lessons can be used in response to the huge migration from Central America, he said. “India has more than a billion people, Guatemala has 15 million, El Salvador 6.7 million, Honduras has just over 9 million. So the size isn’t quite the same … but the lesson is still the same. And that’s what we’re trying to duplicate here by sending out this detailed information,” he said.


Cuccinelli’s instructions to asylum officers say:

When confronted with evidence of private violence, you must consider whether internal relocation is possible. 8 CFR 208.13(b)(3) provides that factors adjudicators should consider include but are not limited to “whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of relocation; ongoing civil strife in the country; administrative, economic or judicial infrastructure; geographic limitations; and social and cultural constraints such as age, gender, health and social and family ties.” 
Many of the cases arising at the Southern border are cases of individuals that are willing to engage in costly and dangerous international travel – neither of which would be necessary if they sought refuge within their home country, particularly given the fact that there are areas that are generally very safe within each of the countries that currently make up the bulk of our credible fear cases. Asylum officers should be eliciting testimony to determine if the alien attempted to internally relocate to any safe areas prior to the alien’s travel to the United States.



In recent weeks, asylum officers within USCIS have publicly announced their opposition to the administration’s pro-American policies. For example, asylum officer Charles Tjersland posted a July 19 op-ed in the Washington Post explaining his objections to the administration’s policies:



When I started working as an asylum officer more than 26 years ago, it seemed like a dream job. At the time, hundreds of thousands of Central Americans were fleeing horrific political repression by their governments, which had the backing of the United States. I was a law student in Washington, working at an aid center for recent immigrants. Most of my friends and colleagues were pretty skeptical of the federal government. But I thought that this could be a way to help people, while fighting for what I thought America should be: a beacon of freedom, offering refuge to those in need.



The Trump administration’s policies have turned the process into a Kafkaesque nightmare. My colleagues and I have interviewed thousands of asylum seekers from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras and told them that they had to return to Mexico while their cases were processed — knowing all the while that they might be kidnapped, assaulted or killed. Under MPP, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” we’re not allowed to let them stay here. We’re forced to put them back in danger.
…
These new policies make a mockery of our mission. The roughly 600-strong asylum officer corps was founded to identify bona fide refugees and protect them, and to combat any fraud and abuse of the system. We exist to ensure that the United States doesn’t renege on its international treaty obligations or commit a grievous human rights abuse by returning people to places where their freedom or lives are in jeopardy. For decades, one principle has been drummed into us: People have basic human rights, and when they come to our borders, they deserve due process and to be treated with dignity and respect. The things we’re being asked to do today fly in the face of everything we stand for.
Buzzfeed reported July 16 that USCIS asylum officers oppose another Trump strategy which would deny asylum requests by people who do not ask for asylum in the safe countries on their route to the U.S. border: 
The asylum officer spoke with BuzzFeed News on Tuesday, detailing a chaotic rollout of sweeping, unprecedented changes to the asylum policies that she works with often. Like other Americans, she learned of the changes Monday morning via news reports.
“I was horrified,” she said. The officer added that she received no official word on the change until an email with guidance was sent Monday night from the head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services’ asylum division. The email was detailed to BuzzFeed News.
“I saw it right as I was coming to work,” she said. “We’re all aghast.”
Immigration Numbers

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university. This total includes approximately 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or healthcare, engineering or science, software or statistics.
But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately 1 million H-1B workers and spouses —plus roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers.
The government also prints out more than one million work permits for foreigners, tolerates about eight million illegal workers, and does not punish companies for employing the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants who sneak across the border or overstay their legal visas each year.
This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth for investors because it transfers wages to investors and ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.
This policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, even as it also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.
The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.
“If there is a growing flood of foreign labor, the American middle class is no longer going to exist, and Republicans will not have a constituency,” said Hilarie Gamm, a co-cofounder of the American Workers Coalition.",1-Aug-19

Italy prepares for possible Mediterranean refugee crisis this summer

The European Union is working on an emergency plan in case a “serious crisis” develops this summer, which would be the situation is 200,000 or more refugees cross the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy.
In 2016, a record 181,000 migrants crossed from North Africa to Italy via the Mediterranean Sea. From January 1 to April 23 of this year, 36,851 migrants were recorded as crossing – a 45-percent increase over the same period last year. Even more concerning is the fact that summer has not even arrived, and when it does, a huge surge of migrants is expected. The concerns are that total for the year may be close to 300,000.
According to the Dublin Agreement that defines the principles of the European Union, member states are expected to show “solidarity” in managing the refugee problem, so that the entire burden does not fall on Italy. However, there is little agreement on what the term “solidarity” means. The current requirements are that refugees should be distributed to all 28 member states. The target last year for relocation was 160,000 asylum seekers, but because several member states object to having any asylum seekers at all relocated to their countries, only about 15,000 people have been distributed so far in the last two years.

One proposed solution is that cash will be used to encourage countries to meet their quotas. The proposal is that each country will be paid €60,000 for every asylum seeker they take in above their assigned quota, and those not meeting their quotas would be charged the same amount.
On Thursday, the European Commission issued a press release proposing “a sustainable and fair Common European Asylum System.” According to Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs:
If the current refugee crisis has shown one thing, it is that the status quo of our Common European Asylum System is not an option. The time has come for a reformed and more equitable system, based on common rules and a fairer sharing of responsibility. With the proposed reform of the Dublin system, [and the creation of a] true European Agency for Asylum, today we are taking a major step in the right direction and putting in place the European-level structures and tools necessary for a future-proof comprehensive system. We will now put all our efforts into working side-by-side with the European Parliament and Member States. We must turn these proposals into reality as swiftly as possible.
If the history of the past two years shows anything, it’s that no current proposal has any chance of working. If move than 200,000 migrants from Libya reach the shores of Italy this year, it truly will be a crisis. Der Spiegel and EU Observer (27-Mar) and European Commission and Malta Today
Europeans blame China and ‘the freeway effect’ for the migrant crisis
Decades ago, when America was first building a national highway system, people talked about “the freeway effect.” If some particular auto route was always jammed with heavy traffic, then a limited access superhighway (also called a “freeway”) would be built to replace it. However, with the availability of the new freeway, a lot more people would start driving, and so pretty soon the traffic would be just as bad as ever. That was “the freeway effect.”
The same kind of thing is happening in the Mediterranean. After some well-publicized drowning of hundreds of migrants in capsized boats, the European Union has made enormous efforts rescue migrants who might otherwise drown. Furthermore, the EU’s Frontex organization has been joined by dozens of NGOs (non-governmental organizations) that are also rescuing migrants crossing the Mediterranean. As greater efforts have been made, more migrants have been encouraged to risk making the trip, contributing to the worsening of the migrant crisis, and creating a “taxi service to Europe.”

A scandal is brewing over the NGOs. Carmelo Zuccaro, an Italian prosecutor is claiming to have evidence that some of the NGOs are colluding with the human traffickers who send the migrants out on flimsy boats to be rescued, with the suggestion that some of the NGOs are encouraging the increase in migrant traffic in order to receive more funding.
The human traffickers have become increasingly unscrupulous in taking advantage of the massive rescue efforts. For example, they have been packing up to 170 people onto inflatable rubber dinghies that can only safely transport 15 people. The engines have only enough fuel to make it out of Libyan waters, and the smugglers have been relying on the rescue efforts by Frontex and the NGOs to save the migrants from drowning. However, over 1,000 migrants have already lost their lives this year alone in the Mediterranean.
Some EU officials are blaming China for the problem.
In a  story about migrants early last year, I reported that human traffickers were importing massive numbers of rubber dinghies manufactured in China, transshipped through Malta.
Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, whom we quoted earlier, is visiting China this week, and made this statement:
The rubber boats used by the smuggler networks in the Mediterranean are fabricated somewhere in China, they are exported to the countries in Asia and they are used by them. So I requested the support and cooperation from the Chinese authorities in order to track down this business and dismantle it, because what they produce is not serving the common good of the country. It is a very dangerous tool in the hands of ruthless smugglers.
There is no word on whether the Chinese government is going to help out Europe by shutting down its rubber dinghy business. Reuters and New Arab (23-Apr) and Reuters

Several pro-asylum seeker groups have spoken out against the move accusing the government of breaking international asylum rules, such as the Norwegian Organization for Asylum Seekers (NOAS) which argued that the conditions in Somali have not changed enough to justify stripping the migrants of refugee status.
“The Somali state can not offer effective protection,” said senior advisor to NOAS André Møkkelgjerd. The organisation is also challenging the decision to remove the refugee status of one Somali in court.
Norwegian State Secretary Torkil Åmland commented on the opposition to the move saying, “The fact that some organisations disagree with the strict asylum and immigration policy that this government is leading is not the same as breaking the rules.”

“The whole basis of the refugee convention is that there are only people with real protection needs that are entitled to stay. Neither the Constitution nor our international obligations mean that a foreign national is entitled to a particular type of permit in Norway,” Åmland added.

Migrants in Norway have become a strain on the country’s generous welfare system with individuals from migrant backgrounds making up half of the welfare recipients in the country.
A report from the Ragnar Frisch Centre for Economic Research released last year also revealed that the longer migrants were in Norway, the more likely they were to be dependent on state handouts and less likely to be employed.
Despite the Norwegian people overwhelmingly resisting mass migration in previous opinion polls, the European Union has pushed for the country, which is not a full member of the bloc, to take in more migrants from Africa.

Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) has become so overwhelmed by refugees making asylum claims that it is giving up on following regulations requiring refugee hearings to be held within a certain time. Regulations drawn up in 2012 required the IRB to hold hearings with 30-60 days, depending on the country of origin.
The system began breaking down in January 2017, when U.S. president Donald Trump began cracking down on illegal immigration and also announced that legal immigrants having a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) would have that status expire. In addition, the status of the “dreamers,” those who were brought to the country as children years ago by their parents, was in doubt.
The U.S. crackdown has created a growing backlog in Canada, as refugees in America have been crossing the border into Canada and applying for asylum. Many refugees and illegal immigrants living in the United States were encouraged to cross the border into Canada when Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a welcome and invitation to the refugees on January 28, 2017, shortly after Trump announced his travel ban:

To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada
Since January 2017, the backlog has been growing at a rate of about 2,100 cases per month. The largest increase so far occurred in September 2017, with a backlog increase of 6,200 cases.
More than 20,000 people, including thousands from Haiti and Nigeria, and hundreds from Turkey, Syria and Eritrea, have crossed the border into Canada illegally over the past year in search of asylum, many fleeing in fear that Trump would deport them to their home countries.
Canada’s IRB has given up trying to follow the 2012 regulations and is simply hearing claims in the order in which they are received. The board will make exceptions for priority claims, such as unaccompanied minors or other vulnerable persons. The backlog has now reached about 43,000 cases with the IRB saying the waiting time for a hearing is almost 2 years.
As the weather becomes warmer, it is expected that there will be a large new wave of migrants entering Canada. The Canadian government has dispatched lawmakers to diaspora communities in the United States to persuade people not to come. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has discussed the situation with the Trump administration, but it has been careful not to publicly blame the U.S. president’s policies for triggering the migration wave.
According to figures published by the Immigration Board, the most asylum requests in 2017 were from migrants from Haiti, with over 8,000 requests, and from Nigeria, with over 5,500 requests. Other countries of origin where the numbers of requests exceeded 1,000 include: China, Colombia, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Syria, Turkey, and Venezuela.

Turkey achieves victory in Afrin, Syria, but Kurds threaten guerilla war
Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed victory in Afrin, Syria, on Monday, after seizing the center of Afrin city. The objective of Operation Olive Branch, launched on January 20, was to seize control of Afrin from the Kurdish militias, People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ), who Erdogan says are branches of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The YPG withdrew on Sunday, rather than risk fighting a conventional war with Turkish-backed forces, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA).
However, the YPG claim that the fight for Afrin is far from over. The Kurdish militias are threatening a guerilla insurgency, with hit-and-run attacks on Turkey’s troops in Afrin. Such an insurgency could prompt Turkey to respond with harsh attacks on the civilians in Afrin.
As things stand, about 200,000 residents of Afrin fled the city in recent days, as Turkey’s offensive escalated. Theoretically, they will be allowed to return to their homes now, but there have been reports of looting by Turkish troops. Furthermore, the residents fear that Turkey will move some of the millions of Syrian refugees who have been living in Turkey for years back into Afrin so that the Kurds will not have a home to come back to.
Erdogan seems emboldened by the capture of Afrin and is threatening to move eastward and attack the YPG in other cities, including Kobani and Manbij. However, the YPG forces in Manbij are backed by US forces, and if Erdogan carries through on his threat, then Turkish forces will be fighting American forces. France 24 and Rudaw (Kurdistan)

Their rhetoric is not asylum rhetoric. Their rhetoric is economic migrant rhetoric.”


LISTEN:


Beck stated that foreigners are exploiting U.S. federal law to enter the homeland with the assistance of certain American lawyers. “They all know, just go to the port of entry, and say some magic words. We’ve heard some reports that these groups are being advised by American lawyers down in Mexico. They’re having seminars, telling them what to say when they get in, in order to game the system.”
Beck noted Congress’s unwillingness to pass legislation supporting Trump’s agenda on immigration and border security. He said, “Lots of talk and no action. There’s not been enough action to back up the president’s promises. This is basically not his fault. It’s Congress [which] has not acted to show the world that we actually mean to enforce our laws and protect our borders.”

Beck described popular political discourse hyping amnesty as a magnet for foreigners aspiring to illegally emigrate to America, saying, “So you can just imagine that before the election, we had a year or two with this build-up, that this DACA amnesty was inevitable. You’ve had most of the Republican voices pretty much saying the same things, and the Democrats have made it their top issue for so long. So this word goes out, and they’re going, ‘Man, there’s a welcome mat here.’”
Widespread support on Capitol Hill for amnesty sends a “signal” to foreigners that illegal immigration will be accepted, remarked Beck.
Beck warned that political rhetoric is an insufficient deterrent to illegal immigration over time. He reflected, “When the 1986 amnesty was passed, there was a big compromise. The deal was that this would be the last amnesty because they were going to make it illegal for companies to hire illegal workers. They thought it would take away the magnet, and illegal immigration stopped. That word went out, and then for a couple of years, illegal immigration really plummeted, but then after a couple of years, the word got out, ‘Hey, they’re still hiring. There’s no teeth in this.’ Chuck Schumer made sure he wrote the law so it wouldn’t have teeth.”
“The same thing happened here,” Beck continued. “We saw a real drop in illegal immigration last year because people heard this rhetoric from President Trump … but then they see all this talk about amnesties They also see that every effort to change some laws to increase enforcement, the Democrats have blocked, and some Republicans have worked along with it. Just think what that says to people. It says, ‘Listen, America’s still open for business for illegal immigrants.'”
Beck pointed to a legal “loophole” within federal immigration.

Beck said Democrats are “absolutely opposed to closing that loophole.”
Beck highlighted economic damage wrought by illegal immigration, saying, “Illegal immigration balloons the labor-force size, and the laws of supply and demand cannot be repealed by Congress. … If you have an excess workforce, then the price of labor goes down. All the studies, even the studies by very pro-immigration expansion think tanks will acknowledge that immigration — both legal and illegal — will hurt people at the bottom of the ladder.”

Beck added that illegal immigration increases unemployment among American citizens. He explained, “There are 50 million working-age Americans who do not have a job. Most of them are not in the workforce at all; hence, they’re not counted in the unemployment rates. We have just a huge number of Americans, and it’s particularly troubling in terms of the millennials, who are basically being buried into lives of dependency, on government, charity, and family, rather than the dignity of work and taking care of yourself. … For every hundred of these caravan people that come in and take a job, there’s going to be something approaching a hundred Americans who are going to stay out of the workforce and being dependent.”
Illegal immigration, Beck continued, lowers wages for many laborious lines of work. “It also continues to collapse occupations,” he explained. “Whole occupations have collapsed, a lot of it because of illegal immigration — for instance, roofing, meatpacking, drywalling. There are just so many of these occupations that used to pay middle class wages. They no longer do because of the availability of this illegal foreign labor.”
Beck called on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to pass legislation to close a “loophole” restricting the federal government’s ability to easily repatriate foreigners from states other than Canada or Mexico. He said, “Speaker Ryan and Senate Majority Leader McConnell, I believe, should just bring a simple bill that closes that loophole. That’s the only thing it does — just that one bill to close the loophole. Force everybody to vote, and have people up or down on whether they want to encourage these caravans and these surges. I think that’s what they ought to do on one thing after another. There’s an election coming up, and people can decide whether they want to vote for the candidates … who want to keep the border open, or are they going to back law and order? I think Congress has been way too timid. The Republican leaders there seem scared to death to ever bring a vote on something that will fail.”

Beck advised Trump and the administration to push for mandatory E-Verify use by employers, saying, “I have to blame the president and the Trump administration for one big gap in what they’ve done, and that is there’s been almost nothing said about mandatory E-Verify from this administration. I’m so appreciative of this administration having the four pillars that include ending chain migration and the visa lottery. There’s really never been any pushing on cutting off the jobs magnet.” He praised the Securing America’s Future (SAF) Act, a proposed bill including a national mandate for E-Verify use by employers.
Beck said halting illegal immigration cannot be done without an E-Verify mandate. “You can put the national guard on the border, you can do all kinds of things, you can have a fantastic wall or fence, but until you cut off the jobs magnet — and I think mandatory E-Verify is the primary way to do it. I think it’ll do most of the work. You’re going to have an amount of illegal immigration,” he said. “The word has gone out to Central America and countries all over the world that if you can get through Mexico and get across that border, you will get a job because the employers are hiring, and there’s very little being done to stop those employers.”
Beck proposed using military resources to assist in the construction of fencing and walls along the southern border. He said, “All these engineering units in order to train — they need to build things. So instead of building things on military bases that they then tear down after they’ve built them, for the experience, they might as well be building this multi-layer fencing or wall or whatever is the right thing to build at any point. Those exercises [and] materials are already being paid for. So there does seem to be some real room. … There’s money in the system and training in the system, it seems to me, that we could put our military to work.”
Beck framed Republicans political fortunes as being tied to their action — or inaction — on combating illegal immigration and securing the U.S.-Mexico border. He remarked, “For Republicans who have been on the pro-enforcement side, they have control of the Senate largely because of running on this very issue about protecting the borders back in 2014 — and they have not shown much initiative, at all. They constantly hide behind, ‘Well, the Democrats stop us.’ … If Republicans do nothing on immigration, I think that they’re guaranteeing that they’re going to lose control. What they need to do if they want to keep control is show to the people that put them in office that they’ll do all they can, and I don’t think they’re showing that.”

While both Albania and Georgia are considered safe countries for deportation, the influx is putting the asylum bureaucracy under even more strain as asylum seekers with little chance of gaining refugee status clog the system.
France has, for the past two years, had agreements in place with the governments of both countries to prevent the flow of bogus asylum seekers, and while Albanian migrants have decreased by 23 per cent, according to interior minister Christophe Castaner, the issue still remains.


Last year, France saw a record number of asylum claims, well over 120,000, which followed the previous record-breaking year. Of those who came to France last year, less than half were actually granted refugee status.
The French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) also noted that there was a surge of Afghan migrants in 2018, with the number of Afghan applications for asylum up 55 per cent compared to the year before.
One prefect told Le Figaro that not only does France see migrants coming from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, but also from Germany and Belgium where rejected migrants are sent back to France.
In total, around 330,000 “irregular” migrants are covered by state medical aid but not all illegals receive benefits, putting the actual number of illegals living in France into question.
In the Paris suburbs of Seine-Saint-Denis alone, some have estimated there could be as many as 400,000 illegal migrants, a figure that would make illegals up to 20 per cent of the population of the area.

It will save two to four days, on average.”


The quicker return of migrants helps to reduce the numbers in U.S. detention centers, and it reduces the overcrowding pressure which forces officials to release migrants into the United States to take jobs from Americans and to plead for asylum.
The faster deportations to Guatemala is a useful win in broader back-and-forth political struggle with the establishment of pro-migration politicians, judges, investors, and activists throughout the United States. In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has pocketed gains — a shift in public opinion in Mexico and new U.S. repatriation policies, for example  — and taken losses, such as a California judge’s decision to block Trump’s reforms of asylum procedures.
The new Guatemalan repatriation process is one of several gains from a round of border meetings held with Guatemalan and Honduran officials in mid-June, McAleenan said.

The round of meetings reportedly triggered a dispute with White House officials who noted the meetings coincided with “World Refugee Day.” The day is an annual agitprop event created by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which pushes for greater migration into the United States:
Around the world, communities, schools, businesses, faith groups and people from all walks of life are taking big and small steps in solidarity with refugees. This World Refugee Day, we challenge everyone to join together and take a step with refugees. Join the movement.
“We had long-standing plans to bring the First Ladies of Guatemala and Honduras, their ministers of security, their ministers of foreign affairs, to the border to see the challenges we’re facing with their nationals in our custody, and the fact that these are the two countries that are sending the most immigrants to our border that our crossing illegally every month of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said. He continued:
We wanted them to understand the conditions that we’re are facing in this crisis and to do more on their end to stop the [migrants] coming in the first place. One we had that trip organized, and commitments from those senior-level people, we were not going to cancel it. None of us were aware that this was World Refugee Day.
“When we heard that World Refugee Day happened to be on the same date, I had our head of public affairs working with the White House to make sure everyone was comfortable, and [to ensure] we could maintain this trip because it was important to address the [migrant] crisis and ideally getting the governments of Guatemala and Honduras more engaged in reducing the flow,” McAleenan said. “We worked it through, and we had the trip, and not a mention was made of World Refugee Day.”
The meetings were successful, he said:
What we have is commitments from Guatemala to take singe adults and family units without travel documents back in an expedited fashion, to get them out of our custody and repatriate them more quickly from the border. We’re going to have our first flight on Friday.
We got a commitment for Guatemala to address adults crossing into their border with children to ensure they are actually traveling with their own kids and that they are properly documented.
We got them to commit to having unaccompanied children, 17 and under, to ensure they have the proper paperwork and permission from their parents to travel instead of letting them transit Guatemala. All of these things were implemented in the weeks after the visit.
However, officials in Guatemala have backed away from a proposed comprehensive immigration reform deal that would require migrants passing through Guatemala to ask for asylum before traveling onto the United States.

Various pro-migration groups have lobbied Guatemala’s elite to reject the proposed “Safe Third Country” deal with the United States. Trump is threatening to impose penalties on Guatemala for not finishing the deal:

….Tariffs, Remittance Fees, or all of the above. Guatemala has not been good. Big U.S. taxpayer dollars going to them was cut off by me 9 months ago.

“We continue to work with Guatemala to follow through on our shared commitment to limiting human trafficking and smuggling through Guatemala,” McAleenan told Breitbart News. “We need them to do more.”

Immigration Numbers

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university. This total includes roughly 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or healthcare, engineering or science, software or statistics.
But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately 1 million H-1B workers and spouses —plus roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers.
The government also prints out more than one million work permits for foreigners, tolerates about eight million illegal workers, and does not punish companies for employing the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants who sneak across the border or overstay their legal visas each year.
This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth for investors because it transfers wages to investors and ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.
This policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, even as it also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.
The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions. The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.
“If there is a growing flood of foreign labor, the American middle class is no longer going to exist, and Republicans will not have a constituency,” said Hillarie Gamm, a co-cofounder of the American Workers Coalition.

Dr Destexhe discussed his book and explained his concerns in a recent interview with French newspaper Le Figaro.


Destexhe claims that Belgium, along with other countries like France, has “lost control” of immigration, saying: “About three-quarters of immigration, in Belgium as in France, is beyond the control of the country’s administrative authorities.
“This immigration, over which we have almost no control, comes either through family reunion [chain migration], through an asylum application, or illegally.”
“A large part of the immigrant population is not integrated, neither economically (it depends strongly on the social system), nor culturally, which is even more serious: they live according to value systems that are sometimes incompatible with our laws, our history, and our traditions,” he added.


“Family reunion” is one of the major concerns for Destexhe, who noted that chain migration accounted for around half of the total immigration into Belgium. He also singled out Belgium’s formerly lax naturalisation laws that were changed in 2012, saying that they led to Brussels being nearly one-third “new Belgians”.
“I think it’s a world record,” he said.
On the topic of the “right of asylum,” Destexhe referred to the asylum process as a new “Eldorado” for migrants: “In Belgium, you have a system of free care, free education, a guaranteed income for society, effective police and justice: I use the word Eldorado.”
Focusing the blame for the 2015 migrant crisis solely on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Destexhe said: “During the refugee crisis, I made a trip to Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan: the lives of refugees were not threatened! They lived in difficult conditions, it’s true, but they were not in danger.”

“To say that they had to be welcomed because their life was threatened was a form of manipulation. We had to help them, it’s a certainty! But we had to do it on the spot, we did not have to let them come to Europe,” he explained.
Destexhe’s views are a stark contrast to the current leadership of Médecins Sans Frontières, which has been at the forefront of migrant ferry activity in the Mediterranean Sea and only cancelled their operations last month due to pressure from the populist Italian government and others.
The interview is also not the first time Destexhe has spoken out about mass migration. Last year, writing for Le Figaro,  he again slammed the elites, saying they concealed demographic trends and changes, and blaming “the multiculturalist lobby which dominates universities, NGOs, public institutions and the media.”

Earlier this week, Miri arrived back in Germany, allegedly illegally by land crossing, and visited the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) in Bremen to claim asylum status. Police arrested him immediately afterwards.
According to Bild, Miri is seeking asylum in Germany after being threatened in Lebanon. He also wants to look into taking legal action against his prior deportation from Germany.
Paul Ziemiak, General Secretary of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), commented on the return of the gang leader saying: “It makes me angry that a criminal clan boss tries to ridicule our rule of law. The Bremen Senator for Justice must now urgently ensure that Ibrahim Miri is deported again.”


“The authorities must clarify how, despite entry restriction, a criminal deported to Beirut can, only a short time later, appear again in Bremen,” he added.
Miri’s gang operates in Bremen, Berlin, and Essen, and is associated with drugs, prostitution, trafficking, and weapons. He faces up to three years in prison for illegally entering Germany.
Germany has faced problems with migrant clans, primarily made up of Middle Eastern migrants and those from migrant backgrounds, for years. Earlier this year, German Islamic and migration researcher Ralph Ghadban blamed the ideology of multiculturalism for their rise in power.
Mr Ghadban went as far as to claim that the gangs had turned areas of Berlin into no-zo zones. “No-go areas are a law-free area. Policemen are persecuted, besieged, and harassed. Policewomen are groped. They receive threats from clan members such as ‘we know where you live’ or ‘we know where your children go to school’, but they are usually empty threats,” he said.
Thomas Spaniel, an organised crime specialist with Berlin’s police force, said last year that the clans were also recruiting asylum seekers and other migrants. “The clans have systematically been recruiting refugees for the dirtiest jobs, such as selling drugs in parks and the subway,” Mr Spaniel said.

Chairman of the committee, Stephen Twigg, said in a statement: “It is so important that the UK behaves at home as it is asking some of the world’s poorest nations to do.
“We should not be asking nations to house and employ refugees when the numbers we take in are so small, and the employment freedoms limited,” the Labour MP added.
Asylum seekers’ “right to work” is “essential to enabling self-reliance and dignity”, according to the report, which insists that the UK government “must lead by example” on this issue, and review current policies preventing most foreign nationals who sneaked into Britain illegally from taking up paid employment.


The recommendation echoes months of growing calls on this issue from NGOs and celebrities, however policy think tank Migration Watch warned strongly against the loosening of restrictions in October, noting that such a move would encourage illegal economic migration, when already more than half of the 26,000 asylum claims made in the UK each year are unsuccessful — even after appeal.
According to the MPs’ report, which repeatedly refers to commitments under the UN Global Compact for Refugees signed in December last year, Britain should also raise the number of refugees it resettles directly from third world camps to UK towns and villages from just over 5,000 a year to 10,000 annually.
Highlighting figures from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre which alleged that 15,000 people had to leave their homes every day in 2017, in sub-Saharan Africa, the committee said Britain should raise the number of refugees it resettles from the region up from 450 in 2017/18 to 2,500 per annum in future years.

Analysis from immigration policy watchdog organisations such as NumbersUSA have long pointed out that resettling large numbers of people from poor countries in wealthy Western nations does nothing to resolve the challenges in the former — especially with the third world’s population set to explode in coming decades.
A 2015 report by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) argued it would be much more cost-effective for Western nations to help Middle Eastern refugees in the region, where caring for 12 displaced people would cost the same as resettling just one in the U.S.
The London-based NGO War Child arrived at similar figures when looking at the economics of resettling people in EU nations, reporting in 2016 that “caring for the basic needs of a refugee in Europe costs at least ten times as much as in countries neighbouring Syria.”",5-Mar-19

A BAMF spokeswoman said that they have become aware of the cases through working with the federal police Mitteldeutsche Zeitung reports.


Though BAMF has said they are aware of more cases, they still refuse to keep any statistics on the subject so no exact figures can be known. The Federal Police, who also do not keep any statistics, say that the problem is “not isolated” indicating the phenomenon may be pervasive.
BAMF also noted that there are currently no laws in Germany which prevent migrants from travelling back to their home countries once they have achieved asylum status. Some cases are justified according to the agency, such as the serious illness of close relatives.
EU regulations state that asylum seekers do not lose their asylum status if they return to their home country. Despite this, BAMF states that if the trip can be confirmed to be a holiday it can lead to Germany cancelling the asylum seekers refugee status.

Last September the trend fo migrants going back to their home countries for holiday made headlines in Germany as many of them were still being paid money by the German government through the Hartz IV welfare scheme.
Germany is not the only country in which migrants have been using taxpayer money to return to their countries on holiday. In Switzerland, newspaper Basler Zeitung claims that there have been thousands of cases of migrants from Eritrea claiming benefits from the Swiss state and going on holiday in Eritrea.
Close to 50,000 applications are made by migrants in Switzerland with the vast majority being approved.
Eritreans are one of the most represented nationalities among migrants crossing the central Mediterranean route along with others from central and western Africa. Though all claim asylum in Europe, the European border agency Frontex has claimed that many are moving to Europe solely for economic reasons.
In order to get asylum approval, many migrants are turning to unusual schemes to avoid being rejected. One scheme has seen migrants confessing to murders and other crimes that could lead to the death penalty in their home countries. EU laws prevent Germany or any other member state from deporting migrants to countries why they may face torture or death.

During the secretly recorded footage, Ms Ricker admits that her group help migrants put on an “act” to get a better chance at asylum saying, “[The European Asylum Support Office] says, ‘This is a refugee in trauma, they have these characteristics,’ so we coach people how to have these characteristics.”
“We teach them … how to keep their private trauma private because all this acting is a shield. I tell them this is acting, all of this is acting, it’s all acting as though this is theatre. So for them to get through they must act their part in the theatre, and that is the refugee in trauma because these EASO officers are so fucking stupid, all they know is written on the paper,” Ricker added.
Following the release of the footage, Advocates Abroad admitted that the footage was of Ricker but claimed it to be heavily edited. Soon after the admission, the NGO deleted both their Twitter and Facebook pages.

The European Asylum Support Office later commented on the footage to Buzzfeed saying, “We strongly reject and regret such crude statements on our personnel working tirelessly to support the Greek authorities,” in reaction to its officers being labelled “fucking stupid” by the activist.

Advocates Abroad has been operating in Greece since 2016 and claims to have advised as many as 15,000 asylum seekers claiming to provide “reliable, timely, and accurate legal aid,” according to the group’s official website which remains online.
The recording is just the latest scandal revolving around a pro-migrant NGO operating in Greece.
Last year, members of the U.S.-based Mercy Corps NGO, which receives funding from left-wing billionaire George Soros, were placed under investigation by Greek authorities after allegations that activists had been engaged in sexual abuse of migrants in Greek asylum centres.
Earlier this year, another NGO ran into trouble with Greek law enforcement, being accused of assisting illegal migration into Greece.
Up to 30 members of the Emergency Response Centre International (ERCI) NGO have been accused by Greek police of being a criminal network aiding people smuggling into the country.
In February, two members of the organisation were arrested for “espionage and violation of state secrets” after using official rescue frequencies and were caught driving a vehicle with forged military licence plates. Three more activists were arrested in August in connection with people trafficking claims.

Vaughan described existing U.S. refugee asylum policies as incentivizing foreigners to seek entry into the homeland via their humanitarian provisions, recalling previous analyses offered on an earlier migrant caravan’s access to America.
“It’s really our policy that is enticing them to come, and I am surprised it took this long,” said Vaughan. “This is not the choice of the Trump administration. It certainly does not want to entice people to take this dangerous journey, and when you look the pictures, it is a lot of young men, but it’s also some kids coming, too. It’s dangerous for them, but it now has this aura of an adventure that people are taking, like the gold rush or something.”

“[Migrants] are being told by the smugglers — who I’m sure are among them, or the organizers, I mean they’re really almost the same thing — to [travel to the U.S.]. Certainly they’re being egged on by the humanitarian groups and even by groups within the United States.”
In April, Left-wing American lawyers offered migrant caravan travelers “legal training sessions,” advising migrant what to say to improve their likelihood of obtaining entry to the U.S. in their dealing with immigration judges and asylum officers.
Mansour asked, “What is the incentive for people not to come?”
“There is no incentive [for them not to come],” replied Vaughan. “This could be a much larger group by the time it gets to our border. It started out as I think 160 men, then word got around. It was like the Pied Piper, they started joining, and next thing you know, it’s at least 1,600 people [with] some accounts placing it closer to 2,000. We’ll see what happens.”

Vaughan added, “Why wouldn’t it grow? They are realistically optimistic that they will be let into the United States. At some point, the Trump administration, the best possible solution is for them to say, ‘No.’ Or put pressure on Mexico to not issue them transit visas. They have no basis to enter Mexico unless Mexico is going to give them asylum.”
Vaughan described Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s news directives to immigration judges and asylum officers.

“Claiming to have witnessed violence or to have come from a violent place is not good enough to get you into the country to make an asylum claim, to pass your ‘credible fear’ test,” stated Vaughan. “They’re expected now to show that the persecution that they claim was carried out by the government, or with the government’s blessing. General violence is not going to cut it.”
Vaughan added, “If they make it all the way to California, they’re going to be flown back to Central America, and it’s a big deal to try to come back after that happens. I think that would be pretty discouraging to anyone.”
Vaughan warned that some judges and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) employees are resisting the Trump administration’s immigration, refugee admission, and border security policy directives.

“The problem is they have to get asylum officers and judges to actually do that, to follow that guidance. And they’re getting some resistance from within the ranks, the judges themselves and some of the career core at USCIS. There will be some lawsuits.”
Vaughan said, “The best possible solution is to not let [caravan migrants] enter,” adding that “it is obvious to everyone” that the caravan migrants’ motivations are “economically based.”


Vaughan explain, “The goal should be to have people not get across, at all, because then it’s a whole different story once they set foot in the United States, whether they’ve been admitted or paroled or whatever. As soon as we let them across, that’s when it becomes extremely difficult to remove them and return them to their home countries.”
Vaughan explained the Trump administration’s “pilot program” at the San Ysidro, CA, point of entry.
Vaughan said, “The Trump administration also implemented a pilot program at San Ysidro which is the busiest crossing point near San Diego, which is far from where a lot of these migrants have been coming, but it one place that has seen a lot of them. They set up a pilot program there that if even a family showed up and asked for asylum, they’ve kept them in custody at the border holding facility and adjudicated their claims immediately, and the asylum officer was right there and the judge is supposed to be right there, too.”
Vaughan continued, “We haven’t seen any result as to how that’s working, and that way they could be removed very quickly if their case is adjudicated; in other words, they don’t even need to transferred to ICE custody, that CBP and USCIS together can deal with them. … The important thing is that they would be dealt with very quickly at the border itself and never really allowed to be admitted [or] enter the country.”
Mansour asked if the aforementioned migrants can legally appeal denials of their asylum requests.
“Not after the immigration judge issues a final order of removal,” replied Vaughan. “If you have judges who are inclined to follow the guidance of the attorney general and do their job the right way, then it should work, but if you get judges that are part of the resistance then it’s not going to work. This is happening all over the border. … They’re dropping them off, every day, dozens of them at the bus center, because they have nowhere to put them.”

Though the plan is to employ the workers at less than subsistence wages, Germany’s Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Andrea Nahles is speaking of the new plan as a “springboard” for migrants to enter the labor market.
The program was forged as a means of dealing with the “forced inactivity” of tens of thousands of migrants living in refugee centers with nothing to do, waiting for documents that sometimes takes months and sometimes never arrive at all.
Now, for no more than twenty hours a week, illegal migrants can work at a nominal salary, which advocates say will allow them to scrape together a few euro more while providing a needed service for the community. Analysts say that the immigrants will amass a mere 84 euro per month, which more or less corresponds to the personal expenses of asylum seekers.

The unskilled labor being offered to the migrants includes serving food, repairing beds and watering plants as “mini jobs” that refugees can undertake in exchange for wages of a euro an hour.
Ladle and spatula in hand, Zaid, a 23-year-old Iraqi immigrant, lifts the cover off a pan filled with goulash and potato croquettes. As he spoons out serving-size portions, he tries to explain to other migrants the recipe for this “very German” dish, seasoned with oil and beef broth.
From 6:30-8:30pm, Zaid is employed by the city of Berlin to distribute dinners to another 152 Syrian, Iraqi, Afghan and Moldovan refugees, who reside in a Berlin gym that has been transformed into a temporary shelter.
“In the short term, this is a judicious measure since otherwise the refugees would have no chance to work,” said Ronald Bachmann, an economist at the RWI institute based in Essen. While their requests are being processed, asylum-seekers have no right to work legally.
“Seeing refugees working also sends a political signal,” said Bachmann, referring to the rampant criticism of migrants living at the expense of the German State.
The new plan is not without its critics, with human rights groups comparing the scheme to sweatshops whose products are regularly boycotted by first-world nations.
Conservatives have also been quick to criticize the plan, such as Stefan von Borstel of Germany’s Die Welt newspaper, who claims that the plan is a ruse by the government to improve employment statistics.
In the meantime, the experiment is already active in many German cities in Germany. In Bavaria, 9,000 migrants are already at work, while in Berlin there are some 4,000 asylum-seekers employed in this type of job. In the city of Hannover, immigrants can work repairing bicycles, sorting clothes or accompanying children to the nursery, in exchange for German classes.

The large number of individuals remain in the country despite having no right to do so, and the government being theoretically obliged to encourage them to leave, or to deport them.



The rise in those subject to deportation in the United Kingdom may be down in part to the fact that fewer individuals are now being deported. British newspaper The Times reports deportations have fallen 42 per cent in the past four years, with a 27 per cent drop of removals from 4,819 to 3,471 in the past 12 months alone.
Overnight, a UK Border Force cutter intercepted two migrant boats in the English Channel, which carried 28 illegals between them. As is customary under British government protocols, the migrants were brought ashore in Dover and given to immigration officials who will then decide whether the individuals caught in the process of breaking into the United Kingdom will be awarded refugee status or added to the rapidly rising number of those denied status, but also not deported.

Crossings of the English Channel by small boat is an emerging trend for illegal migration to the United Kingdom, which in the past has been characterised by people smuggling by freight crossing to Dover, and those overstaying their visas. The BBC reports over 970 people are known to have crossed the Channel this year alone.

On Monday, newly installed UK Home Secretary Priti Patel gave her office 72 hours to create an emergency immigration plan for “immediate implementation”. A government source quoted by the Daily Mail newspaper states these measures will focus on prevention, with Britain supporting French police patrolling their north coast, preventing illegals form setting out on the dangerous journey north at all.
Risks posed to illegals attempting to force entry to the United Kingdom rather than travel by legitimate means was tragically underlined this week when it was revealed an Iraqi male had drowned in the English Channel as he attempted to swim from France to England. The man, who was reported to have been already refused asylum status in Germany was discovered in the southernmost part of the North Sea off the Belgian coast wearing swimming flippers and “covered in fish nets with plastic bottles… to make it more easy to swim for him.”
A spokesman for the UK Home Office said the death of the Iraqi male was tragic and that “Anyone seeking to swim across the Channel or to cross this dangerous stretch of water in a small boat is taking a huge risk.”",27-Aug-19

The International Organization for Migration tweeted that 301 migrants on three boats were intercepted on Saturday and brought back to Tripoli. Another 105 migrants on two boats were intercepted on Sunday.

It said most of the migrants were taken to detention centres in Libya, where there are “serious concerns over their safety.”
Some migrants managed to escape at the disembarkation point, as the boats were brought back to shore, the IOM said.
“It is unacceptable for this to continue despite repeated calls to put an end to the return of vulnerable people to detention and abuse,” said Safa Msehli, a spokeswoman for the IOM.


Libya, which descended into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, has emerged as a major transit point for African and Arab migrants fleeing war and poverty to Europe.
Most migrants make the perilous journey in ill-equipped and unsafe rubber boats. The IOM said earlier this month that its estimated death toll among migrants who tried to cross the Mediterranean had passed the “grim milestone” of 20,000 deaths since 2014.
In recent years, the European Union has partnered with the coast guard and other Libyan forces to stop the flow of migrants.
Rights groups say those efforts have left migrants at the mercy of brutal armed groups or confined in squalid and overcrowded detention centres that lack adequate food and water.
The EU agreed earlier this year to end an anti-migrant smuggler operation involving only surveillance aircraft and instead deploy military ships to concentrate on upholding a widely flouted UN arms embargo that’s considered key to winding down Libya’s relentless war.

Australia moves migrant children from Nauru immigration camps to Australia


Nauru immigration camp (AAP)


As a result of Federal Court orders, the Australian government is in the process of moving all migrant children and their families from Nauru immigration camps to Australian cities and towns. Fifty minors and their families have come to Australia since October 15, for a total of 135 people, and the remaining 35 minors are expected to be transferred by Christmas.
Since August 3, 2013, when the government of Australia signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government of the Republic of Nauru, refugees and asylum seekers arriving by boat without a visa would be sent either to Nauru or to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and would have “no chance” of being resettled in Australia as refugees.
The decision to send “boat people” to the offshore islands has been extremely controversial, both domestically and internationally, as NGOs claim that the offshore islands are filthy and unsafe. Despite the objections from activists, the policy has been extremely successful in meeting its objectives. While there had previously been tens of thousands of “boat people” per year arriving in Australia, that number has been reduced to almost none, because refugees know that they will be transferred to one of the offshore detention centers. Australian officials claim that thousands of refugees’ lives have been saved since they did not attempt the risky boat trip with human traffickers.

Activists have been using the courts and political pressure to force the government to bring all refugees on the islands to be resettled in Australia. Different government officials since 2013 have all refused, saying that any such move would trigger a new flood of boat people from Indonesia.
New Zealand has volunteered to take 150 refugees from Nauru and PNG and resettle them. However, Home Secretary Peter Dutton has rejected this offer because intelligence surveillance of smuggling operations had detected “increased chatter” and “talk about elections and change of government here,” according to Dutton. “My judgment at the moment, based on all of the advice available to me, is New Zealand would be a pull factor at this point in time.” The phrase “pull factor” refers to a possible resurgence of boat people.
However, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that he would only consider the New Zealand offer if legislation were passed that would prevent the refugees from simply leaving New Zealand and coming back to Australia.
Dutton says that the government remains committed to never resettle the refugees in Australia, meaning that they will be deported to their countries of origin after hospital treatment.
As a separate issue, the Obama administration in 2016 agreed to accept up to 1,250 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. ( “6-Feb-17 World View — Trump will honor Australia refugee deal, despite calling it ‘worst deal ever'”)

But after more than a year of screening, only 439 have found new homes in the U.S., and dozens more have rejected the offer to resettle in the United States. According to an NGO, these were mostly people who had family in Australia and were concerned about being separated from them permanently.

Officials of Nauru infuriated by the contemptuous remarks by NGOs and politicians
Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison is warning NGOs and politicians to stop being offensive to Nauru: “For those Nauruans who live there, I do know that they get frankly a bit offended about the way people talk about their home.” Some NGOs have called it an “open-air prison.”

According to Morrison, all the refugee children on Nauru are living freely in the community just like the locals, and that the island nation should not be disrespected: “That is the home of Nauruans – their children live there, their families live there, they go to school there. We should be tempered in our discussion about the nation of Nauru and I think we should treat them with respect.”
Former prime minister Tony Abbott said, “If you like living in the tropics it’s a very, very pleasant island.”
According to the Australian government, 65 medical professionals, including 33 mental health workers, are contracted to serve the refugees on Nauru. According to Abbott, health services are better there than in some parts of regional Australia.

However, these statements are in contrast to warnings by NGOs, the United Nations, and the Australian Medical Association about the appalling state of mental health among young refugees. It was these claims that led to the court order to transfer children to Australia.
The issue is becoming increasingly explosive. A month ago, the government of Nauru expelled the NGO Doctors Without Borders Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières, MSF) which had been providing free mental health care on Nauru. According to Nauru, MSF had originally committed to providing health services for the entire population of 13,000 Nauruans but instead focused on the refugees to further political advocacy.
According to a statement put out by the Nauru government:
For too long, some sections of the media, refugee advocates and some NGOs, have focused only on refugees in Nauru and referred to Nauruans with disdain.
Refugees and locals live side by side as part of a homogenous multicultural community. Calls for refugee children to be removed from our country ignore the fact that Nauruan children grow up here happy, healthy and educated within strong family units. Refugee and asylum seeker children attend school and activities with Nauruan children creating friendships and familial bonds. It is disturbing and concerning that advocates and organizations with political agendas prey on the vulnerable and innocent to progress their agendas. …
The statements made by MSF expose their ruse. It has become very clear that they were never here to help Nauruans as was their initial representation to Government to gain entry into Nauru. They were here as political activists and it was self-evident from the statement made by MSF representatives referring to our sovereign nation, which is our beloved home, as an “open air prison”. This was least expected from an organization proclaiming to be an international humanitarian organization. Nauru has opened its home to refugees awaiting resettlement options. MSF must not define our home as a prison. It speaks of the organization itself.
Nauru is a tiny island, 21 sq km, in the middle of the Pacific. Inhabited for at least 3,000 years, originally by 12 Polynesian and Micronesian tribes, its nearest neighbor, Kiribati, is 300 km of empty ocean away. Nauru was a German colony in the 19th century and an Australian protectorate in the 20th, until independence in 1969, at which time it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world.
It had a massive supply of mineral phosphate. It was strip-mined by mining companies, who packed it up and sold it overseas to be used as fertilizer. Profits were placed into a trust which, at its peak, was valued at $1 billion.
But Nauru became independent in 1969, and then the politicians took over. A series of corrupt and incompetent governments wasted the money and left the country broke and barren by the 1980s, with an unemployment rate of 70 percent. Since then, Australia has had to provide aid to them.
The “boat people” situation has provided an extremely controversial opportunity for both countries. For Nauru, it provided a way to earn extra millions of dollars by housing the refugees. For Australia, it provided a place to send them. Australia AP and NPR and Naura Government and News.com (Australia) and Guardian (London)

In 2019, President Donald Trump’s judges in the immigration courts processed 67,520 asylum claims, or three times the 22,319 cases in 2016, according to data provided by TRAC Reports Inc, at Syracuse University.
  Report Advertisement 

In 2019, the courts denied 69 percent of asylum claims. That is 10 points above the 2016 rejection rate of 59 percent,
So the courts denied 46,755 asylum requests in 2019, four times the 12,188 requests that were denied in 2016.
More cases are being processed because the Department of Justice has added judges and streamlined the process.

The backlog of all court cases rose from 768,257 cases at the end of 2018, to 1 million cases at the end of 2019, as almost 1 million Central American migrants arrived at the southern border. The backlog has risen to 1.1 million since October 2019 as more of the 2019 migrants filed their asylum claims.
Fewer asylum claims are being filed in 2020 because of Trump’s asylum reforms.
The time taken to complete each immigration case is 711 days in 2020. That is slightly lower than the 2018 backlog of 718 days, despite the huge inflow in 2019.
But that backlog is a huge problem, partly because it gives migrants more time in the United States to get jobs and hide from enforcement authorities.
The asylum requests came from people who crossed the border and asked for asylum, and also from people who ask for asylum as they face deportation. The requests came from a variety of people, including victims of political and ethnic oppression, women fleeing spousal abuse, men fleeing criminal gangs, people seeking medical treatment, as well as from economic migrants and migrant criminals.

The bulk of 2019 asylum claims came from the three ‘Northern Triangle’ countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
In 2019, the courts processed 35,7600 asylum requests from those three countries, up from 8,534 claims in 2016.
In 2019, the immigration courts rejected 84 percent of asylum claims made by Central American migrants. That rejection rate is up from 2016 when the courts rejected 74 percent of claims.  In 2016, 6184 Central Americans were denied asylum. In 2019, that number rose five-fold when 29,900 Central Americans were denied asylum.
But the courts have also faced a growing wave of asylum claims from China and India.
In 2016, judges approved 84 percent of asylum requests by 4,016 Chinese asylum-seekers.  In 2019, the courts approved 74 percent of requests from 4,903 Chinese asylum-seekers.
In 2016, judges denied amnesty in 214 of 575 claims by Indians, or 37 percent. In 2019, judges denied amnesty to 37 percent of 3,258 Indian applicants, which was a six-fold numerical increase over 2016.",10-Mar-20

One previously deported illegal alien with the caravan even admitted that he was convicted of attempted murder in the U.S. None of these cases are eligible asylum claims.


The UN Refugee Agency, though, is commanding Trump to accept the caravan of refugees, which some estimates now put at 10,000-strong. In an interview with Voice of America, a spokesman for the UN Refugee Agency said:

Our position globally is that the individuals who are fleeing persecution and violence need to be given access to territory and protection including refugee status and determination procedure. And, if the people who are fleeing persecution and violence enter Mexico, they need to be provided access to the Mexican asylum system and those entering the United States need to be provided access to the American asylum system. [Emphasis added]
As Breitbart News reported, the UN Refugee Agency is aiding the caravan of migrants, putting 45 UN workers on the ground with the group of Central Americans.
President Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week that will halt the caravan entering the U.S. on the legal grounds of national security.
Currently, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants every year, with more than 70 percent coming to the country through the process known as “chain migration,” whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country.
Since 2000, more than 1.5 million foreign refugees have been resettled across the U.S. — outpacing the population of Philadelphia. Also, there have been more than 4.1 million legal immigrants admitted to the U.S. from refugee-producing countries since 2000.

Six have actually been detained, and cases are pending against several more – with prosecutor-general Peter Frank warning politicians that the authorities, which are also contending with suspected Islamic State sympathisers, have now reached “the limits of their capacity”.
Europe has been plagued by a number of mass-casualty terror attacks perpetrated by migrants in recent years. Recent examples include Uzbek asylum seeker Rakhmat Akilov, who drove a hijacked lorry into civilians on a pedestrianised street in Stockholm, and Anis Amri, a Tunisian asylum seeker who carried out a similar attack against a Christmas market in Berlin.
The revelations concerning Taliban fighters in Germany could, therefore, have an impact on the presidential run-off in neighbouring France: anti-mass migration populist Marine Le Pen is facing off against former Rothschild banker and Socialist economy minister Emmanuel Macron, and the issue of border control has been hotly contested.

Ms Le Pen has pledged to quit Schengen, the European Union agreement which eliminates border controls between most EU member-states, very early on in her presidency.
Radical Islamists have previously taken advantage of Schengen, which has been denounced as “an international passport-free zone for terrorists” by former Interpol chief Robert Noble, to attack France, often from extremist enclaves in neighbouring Belgium.

Macron, on the other hand, is deeply committed to the EU, saying that France was a “valley of tears” before the bloc. He also accepts mass immigration will be a fact of life moving forward:
“We have entered a world of great migrations,” he said in February 2017, “and we will have more and more of it.”

Macron is also relatively laid back with respect to terrorism, describing it as “an imponderable problem”, which will be “part of our daily lives for years to come”.
Similar comments after the Nice lorry attack on Bastille Day 2016 by Macron’s former colleague, ex-prime minister Manuel Valls, proved extremely unpopular with the French public, who loudly heckled him at a crowded memorial event.

“Times have changed and we should learn to live with terrorism,” Valls had said following the attack, which killed 86.

On Sunday night alone, 31 people in two small boats — 25 men, three women, and three minors — were stopped at sea, marking the fourth such “incident” in three days.


The migrants were brought ashore in Dover, as is customary under European Union protocols. The illegal aliens will be processed and medically examined before immigration officials will make a determination as to whether any of those caught crossing illegally will be granted asylum.
Those migrants not recognised as refugees — and few if any should qualify, given France is a safe country — will likely be added to the ever-growing number of people in the United Kingdom who have been denied status but not deported.
“The nationalities of those found are yet to be established. Their cases will be dealt with in line with the immigration rules”, a Home Office spokesman told KentOnline.


Though the United Kingdom has faced illegal migrants trying to break in by by boarding ferries, hijacking lorries, and even storming the Channel Tunnel, the illegal sea crossings of the English Channel, reminiscent of those in Italy, Spain, and Greece, are a more recent phenomenon, certainly at the scale the country is currently experiencing.
Despite pronouncements from both the French and British governments a report from the local government in Calais found that an average of five migrant filled boats have set sail for Britain per week since the beginning of the year. So far this year over 1,500 migrants have successfully reached British shores — with only a very small number sent back, thanks to EU asylum rules.
The danger posed to migrants travelling by sea, instead of entering the country by legal methods, was tragically demonstrated over the summer when a man from Iraq attempted to swim to England from France, drowning in the process.
At the time a spokesman from the Home Office said: “Anyone seeking to swim across the Channel or to cross this dangerous stretch of water in a small boat is taking a huge risk.”

The Italian leader granted port access to the Sea Watch 3 vessel with 119 migrants on board on Tuesday, with the vessel docking at the port of Taranto, while the port of Messina is expected to receive a vessel from the Spanish NGO Open Arms, Il Giornale reports.


“We are happy that our guests can finally step on safe land, but there is still a lot that needs to be changed: Shady deals with Libya, further ad-hoc agreements, EU-funded human rights abuses, this must stop!” Sea-Watch stated on Twitter.
The move comes as Democratic Party (PD) Chamber leader Graziano Delrio announced that the government would be looking at reintroducing the protection system for asylum seekers and refugees (Sprar) that had seen its centres closed and defunded by the security decree of former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.


Giuseppe Civati, a former member of the PD, said that the Salvini migration and security decrees should be totally abolished and advocated the return of the so-called humanitarian protection residency permit which allows migrants who fail asylum claims because they are not legitimate refugees to remain in the country — a policy that was scrapped by Salvini.
A 2017 report claimed that in 2016 just 2.65 per cent of the migrants who entered Italy were genuine refugees, but 21 per cent were still allowed to remain in the country under the humanitarian protection policy.
While the number of migrants entering Italy was greatly reduced in the first half of 2019, thanks to the pro-border policies of Salvini, the number of new arrivals has risen since Salvini and his League (Lega) party left the government in September of 2019.
“From September to today, considering the immigrants arriving in Taranto, Italy has received 6,249 people. In the previous eight months, with the League in government and more favourable weather conditions for departures, there were 4,976 arrivals,” Salvini said last month.

He bent down to wash the feet of his disciples, laying aside his role as “Lord and Master” and preferring the position of a servant. He is “sold for thirty pieces of silver and betrayed by the kiss of a disciple whom he had chosen and called his friend.” His friends flee and abandon him, and “Peter denies him three times in the courtyard of the temple,” Francis reminded the tens of thousands of faithful gathered in Saint Peter’s Square for the Mass.
The Pope said that Jesus experiences shame and disgraceful condemnation by religious and political authorities, being shuffled around as nobody’s problem. “Pilate then sends him to Herod, who in turn sends him to the Roman governor,” Francis said, and “even as every form of justice is denied to him, Jesus also experiences in his own flesh indifference, since no one wishes to take responsibility for his fate.”
It was the Roman procurator Pilate, in fact, who famously washed his hands in full view of the crowds, refusing to be held accountable for the fate of Jesus. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”

“And I think of the many people, so many outcasts, so many asylum seekers, so many refugees, all of those for whose fate no one wishes to take responsibility,” he said.
The crowds are very fickle, Francis continued, and those who acclaimed him on Palm Sunday change their praise “into a cry of accusation” on Good Friday, even to the point of preferring that a murderer be released in his place.
“To be totally in solidarity with us,” the Pope said, “he also experiences on the Cross the mysterious abandonment of the Father. In his abandonment, however, he prays and entrusts himself: ‘Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.’”
Jesus refuses to react with force, however, but instead “reveals the true face of God, which is mercy,” Francis said.
“He forgives those who are crucifying him, he opens the gates of paradise to the repentant thief and he touches the heart of the centurion,” he said. Jesus pours himself out; he “takes upon himself all our pain that he may redeem it, bringing light to darkness, life to death, love to hatred.”
By humbling himself, “Jesus invites us to walk on his path,” Francis concluded. “Let us turn our faces to him, let us ask for the grace to understand at least something of the mystery of his obliteration for our sake.”

The number of asylum-seekers more than tripled, raising concerns that migrants are filing dubious asylum claims because normal migration visas have been cut back. 


Australia’s ABC News noted the number of applicants for asylum jumped 311 percent last year, but the vast majority of them were rejected under Australia’s stringent policies:
Onshore protection visa applications from those who arrived by plane from the People’s Republic of China jumped from 2,269 in 2016-17 to 9,315 in 2017-18, the data reveals.
Despite the surge in claims, Chinese nationals had one of the lowest success rates for protection visas, with the Department only recognising 10 per cent of those claims as being genuine.
The total number of onshore asylum claims for all nationalities soared 225 per cent from 8,587 in 2014-15 to 27,931 in 2017-18 with Chinese nationals making up a third of all claims over that period.
A sample transcript presented by ABC revealed some applicants complaining they were effectively locked out of Chinese social programs because they were born in violation of China’s harsh family planning laws – which limited families to one child until recently when Beijing belatedly realized it needs more people and launched an equally ham-fisted campaign to encourage more children. Those born in defiance of government-imposed family limits are known as “black children” and shunned by the Chinese system, to the degree that some said they were unable to attend school.
Other applicants for asylum said they belonged to banned religions such as the disturbing Eastern Lightning Church, the long-persecuted Falun Gong discipline, and the Muslim community of Xinjiang province. Refugee experts pointed to Australia’s booming international education industry as one reason for the surge, as large numbers of Chinese students applied for permanent residence. 

“Chinese tourists and students are an important source of revenue for the government. As of September 2018, there were 652,158 student visa holders in Australia and 30% of those were from China, the biggest cohort from any country, according to figures from the Department of Education,” CNN noted.
Australia granted only about ten percent of protection visa requests from Chinese nationals last year, but legal experts quoted by both ABC and CNN noted the asylum process is rather slow, so applicants could be filing spurious claims to remain in the country a little longer. The most cynical take on the Chinese asylum surge argues that Australian universities are, wittingly or unwittingly, circumventing the country’s tough immigration policies to create a migration surge by bringing in a vast number of students who attempt to game the asylum system.
An op-ed at Digital Journal called it an “immigration racket” and said the Chinese students have been led astray by unrealistic promises of asylum, only to find their applications rejected 90 percent of the time:
The theory, and it is just a theory, is that to get in to Australia you apply for a protection visa, which allows you to get a “bridging” visa while your claim is determined. This bridging visa isn’t any sort of guarantee of getting a protection visa, or being allowed to stay. If your application is disallowed, you can appeal, and stay a bit longer. Odds are you’ll fail, and spend a lot of time and money failing.
You can see where the immigration racket might be doing very well out of this situation. If 10% is the usual success rate, an even lower success rate for appeals, 5%, is the fact. Meanwhile, the fiction is spread around Asia that this is how you get to Australia, and the instant financial and legal minefield isn’t mentioned at all.
Put it this way – It’s a great way to waste tens of thousands of dollars, get nowhere, and get deported. The brutal fact is that a lot of very poor people are getting themselves into a lot of trouble, borrowing money in their home countries to come to Australia and get into more trouble here.
Refugee Council of Australia policy director Joyce Chia told ABC her group has “certainly heard of fraudulent migration agents promising the world to people in relation to protection visas.” 
Conversely, CNN blamed the administration of Prime Minister Scott Morrison for creating an asylum crisis by imposing “hardline immigration policies” that make it too difficult for foreign students to obtain work visas:

Last year Australia overhauled a visa program that allows skilled workers from abroad to hold jobs for up to four years. In November, Morrison refused to sign up to a United Nations migration agreement. And there has been global concern over the country’s controversial offshore detention policy for illegal arrivals by boat, with calls for the immediate transfer from Nauru to Australia of children and those needing medical treatment.
The surge of asylum-seekers from China should be somewhat embarrassing for the Chinese government, which is very eager to present itself as a rising world power with an orderly society and abundant employment opportunities. That desirable image is difficult to square with a 300-percent surge in Chinese citizens begging the Australian government to help them escape.
It is also a difficult topic of conversation for Australia, which faces international pressure to loosen its immigration laws and much criticism of the offshore immigration detention camps. Over a thousand asylum-seekers filed class-action lawsuits Monday alleging human rights abuses and outright torture in Australia’s island camps.
Australians have long argued among themselves about how quickly their society can accept and assimilate Chinese immigrants, a debate made more uncomfortable by suspicions that Chinese migrants could become a seditious force in Australia. Some of the Australians who express unease about Beijing’s influence upon the Chinese immigrant community are themselves Chinese immigrants who are outspoken critics of their former government.
Prior to the striking surge in asylum applicants reported by the Australian Department of Home Affairs, the big story in Chinese immigration was the post-2000 rise of a migrant middle class – not desperate refugees or rich investors looking to buy up property, but educated Chinese with good English language skills who felt comfortable settling far beyond the traditional Chinese enclaves in Australia’s big cities. 
The South China Morning Post speculated just last month that this shift to highly employable and assimilable Chinese immigrants, prone to complimenting the strengths of Australian and remarking that it felt awfully good to live in smog-free cities for a change, could produce a sea change in Australian opinions of Chinese immigration. Australia’s student visa program was cited as a major engine of agreeable Chinese migration, with brokerage industries rising to meet the needs of incoming students and property buyers.",11-Dec-18

A senior official has claimed that the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has opened the borders for Syrian asylum seekers and other migrants and will not prevent anyone from heading to Europe by land or by sea, Reuters reports.


According to the news service, all Turkish border and police officials have been ordered by the government to stand down along with members of the Turkish coastguard.
The move comes after the Turkish government claims to expect a wave of migrants after around one million people were displaced in Idlib.
According to Turkish journalist Ragip Soylu, “Land and sea crossings to Europe would be free to pass for the NEXT 72 HOURS and Turkey will open the borders immediately.”

Following the signing of the migrant agreement, brokered in 2015 and came into effect in 2016, between the European Union and Turkey, President Erdogan and his ministers have made repeated threats to open the border.

— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2019
Last year Erdogan made several threats to “open the gates” including a threat in September in which he demanded aid from European countries to build a “security zone” along the border to settle around one million asylum seekers.
“Give us logistical support, and we can build houses up to 30 kilometres into the north of Syria,” he said and added, “Either that happens, or we open the gates.”
As of September, EU spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud noted that the political bloc had paid Turkey 5.6 billion euros as part of the EU-Turkey migrant pact.
Greece is the likely first stop for any of the migrants heading to Europe in the next 72 hours and was already expecting a surge in migrant numbers this year, with Manos Logothetis, the government commissioner for the initial reception of refugees, predicting 100,000 by the end of 2020.
It is estimated that as many as 3.6 million Syrian asylum seekers are currently in Turkey.

Francis contrasted that gesture with the “gesture of war” carried out by the Brussels attackers on Monday.



Instead of celebrating Mass in the Vatican as usual, the Pope traveled to the welcome center in the town of Castelnuovo di Porto, where he greeted the asylum-seekers, many of whom are not Christians.
The Pope told them that Jesus’ gesture of service stood in sharp contrast to Judas’ gesture of betrayal, which the Pope likened to the brutal jihadist attacks.

In denouncing the attacks, the Pope said its perpetrators wanted to destroy the brotherhood of humanity.
Pope Francis knelt and washed the feet of four Catholics from Nigeria, three Eritrean women who are Coptic Christians, three Muslims from Mali, Syria and Pakistan, a Hindu man from India and an Italian woman who works at the center. Several migrants wept as Francis knelt before them, poured water from a brass pitcher over their feet, wiped them clean and kissed them.
“We have different cultures and religions, but we are brothers and we want to live in peace,” Francis said in his homily, delivered in the courtyard of the welcome center.
“All of us, together: Muslims, Hindi, Catholics, Copts, Evangelicals. But brothers, children of the same God,” he said. “We want to live in peace, integrated.”
In his Palm Sunday homily earlier this week, the Pope spoke of Jesus’ radical humility, living among us in “the condition of a servant” rather than that of a king or a prince, and the abyss of his humiliation “seems to be bottomless.”

He bent down to wash the feet of his disciples, laying aside his role as “Lord and Master” and preferring the position of a servant, Francis noted.
The Pope also compared Jesus to today’s migrants, saying that Jesus had been shuffled around as nobody’s problem. “Pilate then sends him to Herod, who in turn sends him to the Roman governor,” Francis said, and “no one wishes to take responsibility for his fate.”
“And I think of the many people, so many outcasts, so many asylum seekers, so many refugees, all of those for whose fate no one wishes to take responsibility,” he said.
During 2015, Europe processed some 1.3 million asylum claims, of which 292,540 were approved as refugees. The majority came from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Specifically, the status of the Damascus province has been regraded by the Danes, according to Politiken, with Mr Dorph confirming, “Being in the area is not asylum-justified in itself.”
The announcement follows a similar decision by the Refugee Board on Wednesday, which ruled, “The information on the current situation in Syria shows that the number of combat areas and civilian casualties is limited geographically, and that the number has been significantly reduced compared to previous ones.”
Since the migrant crisis of 2015, Denmark has issued 4,700 temporary asylum residency permits, which must be renewed by the migrants annually.

The regrading of the Damascus province will certainly affect future refugee applications, but it is also believed that a number of those individuals currently in Denmark under the temporary asylum scheme could be sent back.
“It will be possible that they may have refused to extend their residence permit as a result of this,” Mr Dorph said.

Denmark, which takes a tougher position on immigration and asylum that its German and other Nordic neighbours, said earlier this week that it would not rule out deporting illegal Somali migrants by force.
“It is not my assessment that there are current challenges in Somalia that mean that we cannot see more compulsory deportations,” Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said.
The remarks came after migration minister Inger Støjberg told Somalis to go back to their own country and rebuild it after the government ruled that parts of Somalia were safe to return to.
While Denmark is considering deportations for those migrants with straightforward returns processes, its government has come up with a novel solution of what to with foreign criminals and ‘undeportable’ migrants — such as those without papers or whose countries will not accept them — by putting them on a remote island a mile and a half from the Danish mainland.",1-Mar-19

Manos Logothetis, the government commissioner for the initial reception of refugees, made the prediction on Wednesday while speaking to media stating that “the crisis is current and it is serious”, German newspaper Die Welt reports.


Logothetis said the conservative Greek government was planning to deport around 10,000 migrants to Turkey in the next year and the government is also looking to expand the current migrant camps on several Greek islands which are currently very overcrowded.
More than 41,000 migrants currently live in the various camps, the highest amount since the European Union signed a migrant pact in 2016 with Turkey to halt the flow of asylum seekers.


So far this year, around 70,000 migrants have crossed from Turkey into the European Union, a 46 per cent increase from 2018 which saw 47,847.
The increase this year and the projected further increase in 2020 has cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Turkey-EU migrant pact in a confidential European Union report detailed earlier this week by Die Welt.
The report states that Greek coast guard have reported that their Turkish counterparts have refused to cooperate with them for several weeks and allowed migrant boats to cross into Greece.
The situation on has become increasingly tense as 41,000 migrants live in camps meant for just 8,530. Refugee workers on the island of Kos were even recently evacuated due to the rising levels of violence as food, clothing, and medications have become more and more scarce.
In order to ease pressure on the islands, Greece has transferred around 34,000 migrants to the mainland, which has led to protests from locals. Some stay in Greece, but the majority are said to push on to the Albanian border to attempt to meet with people smugglers and travel to Western Europe.

The new Balkan route has become more active as a result, with hundreds of migrants travelling through Bosnia, attempting to cross the border into Croatia.
Earlier this month, the Bosnian government cleared the Vucjak camp located near the Croatian border and are said to have transferred as many as 800 migrants to facilities in Sarajevo.

LISTEN:


Mansour quoted Department of Homeland Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen’s statement that the caravan migrants attempting to enter the United States illegally “will be referred for prosecution,” and those who are legally seeking asylum at a port of entry “may be detained while their claims are adjudicated efficiently and expeditiously” and “will be promptly removed from the United States” if their claims are fraudulent.  
Mansour asked Vaughan to explain what federal authorities are doing to expeditiously adjudicate the asylum claims from the caravan’s estimated 600 migrants approaching the California port of entry.

Vaughan replied, “There are a number of things they could do. I don’t think they want to tip their hand too much  because there’s also a caravan of lawyers that’s been recruited from the United States to go meet the caravan of migrants. I don’t think that their choice of Tijuana as a crossing point is just random. I think it’s because they want to try to get into California where there will be more sympathetic judges for the inevitable lawsuit against violating their fundamental human right to an American citizen, as they put it.”
Vaughan recommended denying the caravan’s migrants entry to the U.S. and having them wait in Mexico while federal authorities process their anticipated asylum claims. The caravan’s organizers have stated their plans to enter the U.S. via the San Ysidro port of entry in San Diego, California.
Vaughan said, “[The migrants] said that they’re going to enter the legal port of entry. The problem they could very well face is that recently we haven’t been letting in everyone to make an asylum claim that shows up at the legal port of entry. I’ve been down to that port, it’s called San Ysidro, and — this was two  years ago — the line was out the door. We were still having the same problem with people just showing up, but that was a different administration. The detention space is limited at that location, so what they started doing was telling people — and they got Mexico to actually agree to this — that we’re only going to take ten people a day, and so people literally had to take a number. It was like the deli counter. People would take their number and they’d have to wait in Tijuana for a chance to make their claim.”
Vaughan recommended increasing the number of asylum officers and immigration judges stationed at the San Ysidro port of entry to expedite the asylum requests from the caravan’s migrants. 
“Those who are not admitted can be turned right back, because you don’t actually get into the United States until you’re admitted,” Vaughan explained. “Just showing up at the turnstile is not getting into the United States, so they can be denied entry right then and there if they’re not found to be eligible to enter. None of them have visas. That, I think, would be the easiest option is to set up a one-stop shop — it’s not really asylum adjudication, I would call it asylum fraud rejection right there — because these people do not qualify for asylum.”

Vaughan explained how economically-driven migration does not amount to a legitimate pursuit of asylum. “Most of them are coming for economic reasons,” she said. “I know the administration understands this, they have made this long journey through Mexico. Mexico gave them a visa to be in Mexico and offered them the opportunity to apply for asylum in Mexico, so there’s no reason for them to continue on to the United States. They’ve been offered safe haven, and that can be factored into how we treat these cases.”
Vaughan described the migrant caravan as a challenge to American sovereignty. “This is a test of our resolve to enforce the border and enforce immigration laws. The organizers are trying to make a scene and make the Trump administration look mean and heartless for denying these poor people who walked all the way from Honduras for the chance to live a better life here.”

Vaughan warned of the potential for violence if the caravan of migrants are denied entry to the U.S. “These migrants are props of the caravan organizers, and they think they’re actually going to get in, and it could get a little bit ugly if they don’t,” she cautioned. “I don’t think they’re going to take this very easily, but we have to be firm. We can also tell people that they can apply for asylum in our consulate in Tijuana. We have a branch of the U.S. embassy there and they could wait there while their claim is adjudicated. We can take a couple of weeks to hear their case from our consulate in Tijuana, or Mexico City or anywhere else in the country of Mexico; save them a long journey.”
Vaughan called on the Trump administration to maintain its promises to enforce immigration laws.
“I think the vast majority of them are simply going to be turned around,” she stated. “I hope so. If they are not, then this is a real breach of trust with the American people between Americans and the Trump administration, because the administration has been talking tough and it has to turn out to be not just trash talking but actually enforcing our immigration laws and not allowing a group of demonstrators to basically force their way into the United States just because they want to. 

Vaughan also warned that the migrants who are prevented from entering the U.S. at a legal port of entry through the asylum process may try to cross the border illegally with the help of smugglers. She noted that some of the migrant caravan previously included “MS-13 gang members” and “previously deported criminals.”
“Criminals and gang members who broke off from the caravan early on stayed away from the ports of entry and they’ve tried to enter illegally,” she said. “A number of them have been apprehended by the border patrol. Some of them were MS-13 gang members. Others were previously deported criminals. They wanted no part of the legal port of entry.”
Vaughan said  any Central American asylum applicants who did not file asylum claims in Mexico should have their applications denied. “Even if they are genuine asylum seekers, they should apply in Mexico,” she said. “If you are really fearing for your life, you go to the first safe place.”
Vaughan noted how asylum applicants are legally entitled to request a judge’s review of their application if initially denied by an asylum officer. “If the asylum officer says no, then under law they get to say, ‘I’d like to have a judge hear my case,’ like an appeal,” she explained. “Then it goes to a judge, but we can have a judge sitting at the desk next door, right next to the asylum officer, and hear them out and make a decision.”
Vaughan continued, “Under the Trump administration, asylum officers and judges have been instructed to adhere to the law and to remember … that merely seeking a better life is not a grounds for asylum, that claiming to witness a crime is not grounds for asylum, general violence in their country is not grounds for asylum.  Hopefully they’ll be careful in who they pick to go work on the border and not some of these USCIS employees who’ve set up this resistance movement within the agency. If they follow the law, fewer of these people will be admitted into the United States.”
Mansour asked what the difference is between asylum seekers and refugees. Vaughan explained that refugee status is a matter of international law determined by the United Nations. 
“A lot of the groups that support the caravan and a generous immigration system are referring to these people as refugees, but that’s not the proper term,” Vaughan said. “A refugee is someone who is fleeing persecution and who has been registered with the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees … and the United States agrees to take a certain number of people through that program. This year it’s going to be 45,000. The UN screens them and then they turn them over to us for further screening, so it’s more of a process.”
Vaughan then explained that “asylum seekers are people who show up on our doorstep, like at the port of entry, or the border patrol finds them and they claim asylum. Also, people who are within the country — let’s say you come in on a visa — you have one year in which to make an asylum if you want to, and that’s why we also see a lot of people making what we call ‘defensive asylum claims,’ like they overstay their visa, they come to the attention of ICE and get arrested, and then they say, ‘Oh, no! I want asylum.’ But you have to do that within the first year of arriving.”
Vaughan explained how the asylum system is overloaded through fraudulent and exploitative applications. “The asylum claim is being used as a backdoor into the country for people who don’t qualify for any other admission,” she said. “People game the asylum system all the time. … Under the law, they’re supposed to be put into detention and held in custody until their asylum claim is adjudicated. … When people are in detention they are on a docket that means their case gets heard much quickly.”
Vaughan pointed to the Obama administration’s implementation of a “catch and release” policy as incentivizing abuse of the asylum application process. “So the Obama administration said, ‘No, we’re not doing that anymore. We’re going to release people,’ and then we started seeing more and more people start claiming asylum,” she explained. “Once people figured out that if you made an asylum claim you would be released from custody, and once your claim has been pending for 180 days you can apply for a work permit. So people  were just making the claim, waiting it out, getting the work permit. A large percentage of them never show up for their immigration hearings, but they weren’t a priority for deportation, either. The Obama administration just looked the other way.”
Vaughan continued, “There were so many people applying for asylum that the immigration courts got very backlogged. Last time I heard, if you show up and ask for an asylum hearing, depending on where you show up, it could be four or five years before your hearing. So that’s a huge incentive. It’s like a free pass to live here and work for five years, maybe three, or indefinitely if you skip out on your proceedings. So that’s how … hundreds of thousands of others have been able to game this. The number of asylum claims went up by 18 times over a period of just a few years. It went from like 6000 a year to thousands and thousands a year. It’s out of control.
Vaughan observed how the volume of frivolous asylum applications hurts those in genuine pursuit of asylum. “The real sad part about it is the people who really qualified for asylum, they’re stuck in limbo for years, and many of them have family members who are living in the country that they came from and may be genuinely at risk, but their case doesn’t move along because the courts are bogged down with all these bogus claims,” she stated.
Vaughan added, “It’s been estimated that there could be as high as a 70 percent fraud rate in the asylum program.”
Mansour asked Vaughan if constructing temporary “tent cities” would help supplement the existing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers and reduce the overflow problem driving the “catch and release” policies.
Vaughan specified that “tent cities” would increase ICE’s capacity to detain foreigners who enter the country illegally. “I think it would help for those cases that come in across the border illegally, because they actually do make it to the United States so we can’t return them directly,” she said. “We can’t make them wait in Mexico. They make it here through our porous border, and they should not be released.”
Vaughan recommended the declaration of an “immigration emergency” and deployment of existing military resources reserved for dealing with a massive migration crisis. 
“I think this is enough of a problem right now that it should be declared an immigration emergency,” said Vaughan. “My understanding is that there’s more flexibility available to the executive branch in a situation like this, and they have a plan that they test and think about, it’s like war-gaming a migration emergency. They have the tents that they’re supposed to keep available for such an event. I think the army actually is in charge of the supplies. They could set them up right next to existing detention centers along the border, and they could house people there until they could adjudicate their asylum claim.”
Vaughan continued, “The administration has already said that they plan to send down these asylum officers and lawyers and even prosecutors, because this is the other part of it. Jeff Sessions has said that people who cross the border are going to be prosecuted for the misdemeanor crime that it is, and potentially do time. You can give people a choice, you can sit here and be processed or we’ll prosecute. You can either go home quickly using expedited removal or you can sit in detention and we’re going to charge you with a crime and that’s going to affect your future ability to ever come to the United States; not only that, but you’ll go to real federal prison. I think that will convince some people to take the expedited route home.”
Vaughan described existing infrastructure for detaining and processing illegal aliens as overloaded. “Congress has not provided the administration with enough funding for detention to fully address this problem,” she said. “If they set up these tents, I think it would be more cost-effective and they would actually be able to keep more people in detention in that kind of temporary situation than they’re able to in the real ICE detention centers that exist already, the brick and mortar, so to speak, detention centers. That may be what they have to do. It’s getting that bad. 
Vaughan added, “Since October, there have been something like 50,000 families and children arriving illegally, not to mention all of the men who are coming on their own. This caravan does seem to mostly be teenage [males] or men in their twenties. So they can be dealt with though expedited removal, and if they claim asylum, we ought to have like a night court asylum review process set up right there. It would be due process, but it would be quick due process. That would be a benefit to everybody.”
Vaughan described the caravan migrants as “props” who are “being used” by an “open borders group” seeking to “instigate a lawsuit that they think they might be able to win.”
Vaughan concluded, “We need a wall.”

Sweden May Expel 80,000 Rejected Migrants","Sweden has announced plans to deport some 80,000 asylum-seekers whose applications have been processed and rejected.The Scandinavian country has been overrun by migrants in recent months, and currently has the highest naturalization rate of immigrants of all European nations.


The decision to expel the migrants was announced by Sweden’s Minister of the Interior, Anders Ygeman, who explained that charter flights will be used to convey the migrants back to their home countries over the next several years.
It is “a great challenge,” Ygeman said. “We’re talking about 60-80 thousand people.”
The Minister said he had instructed police and Migrationsverket, the national immigration agency, to proceed gradually with the forced repatriation of the migrants. Sweden has begun talks to coordinate the deportations with officials from the countries of origin, including Afghanistan and Morocco.

“We’ll start with those who leave voluntarily, by creating good conditions and all possible facilities,” he said. “But we cannot limit ourselves to this, and so we have to proceed with coercive measures.”
The government expects a huge number of migrants who have been refused asylum to try to stay in Sweden illegally, hoping to fade into the “gray zone” of anonymity. Sweden has already begun studying measures to punish offenders who employ illegal workers.
About 163,000 migrants and refugees sought asylum in Sweden during 2015, the highest number per capita in all Europe. Of the 58,800 cases processed last year, 55% of the asylum requests were approved, while the remaining 45% were denied.
In 2015, 35,400 of the migrants entering Sweden were unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, five times the number of 2014.
Earlier this week Sweden became the latest in a series of European countries that have experienced tensions due to incidents of migrant-related violence. A 15-year-old immigrant was arrested near Gothenburg after having stabbed to death a 22-year-old female employee of the asylum center he frequented.
Stockholm recently re-introduced temporary border controls, joining five other EU nations in suspending the Schengen agreement due to overwhelming numbers of migrants.

In a fast-track regulation set to publish in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the administration has created a framework that will allow asylum seekers to be sent to other nations that have negotiated bilateral agreements to accept them.
Previously, officials in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump have argued that migrants with a valid need for asylum should seek protection in the first “safe” country where they have the chance to apply, since many migrants travel through multiple countries on their way to the U.S. border.
However, the new regulation states that asylum seekers may be sent [from Texas] to any other countries with which the United States has asylum agreements that permit such an action – even if they did not first transit through those nations.
For example, migrants from Cameroon in Africa, or Bangalore in India, or Honduras in Central America might be told to ask for asylum in Guatemala instead of the United States. If they are given asylum in Guatemala, then U.S. officials will be legally free to deny them the right to request asylum in the United States. Once denied, the migrants cannot use the catch-and-release rules to repay their smuggling debts with cash from jobs in the United States.
The policy is one of the most ambitious of the many policies President Donald Trump is using to shrink economic migration from Central America in the face of massive resistance from Democrats and cheap-labor Republicans.
Pro-migration groups will challenge the new asylum policy in court. Their allies are already slamming the new regulation for delivering migrants back to countries that do not have adequate agencies to process asylum claims.

“Unfortunately, this is just the latest illegal attempt by this President and Stephen Miller to destroy our nation’s asylum system,” said a statement by New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, Chair of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, Chair of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship. “The fact that the Administration coerced a country [Guatemala] with threats of tariffs and attempts to cut off aid do not change the fact that Guatemala remains ill-equipped to protect its own citizens, let alone to meet the needs of migrants coming from other countries,” the statement says.
“UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has serious concerns about the new U.S. policy on asylum published Tuesday, 19 November,” said a statement from the UNHCR, adding:
It is an approach at variance with international law that could result in the transfer of highly vulnerable individuals to countries where they may face life-threatening dangers …
We have been working for years in Central America to support efforts by governments there to address growing forced displacement, strengthen the still very nascent asylum systems and to promote practical, humane responses coordinated at the regional level. While UNHCR is not a party to the bilateral ACA’s, we will continue to exercise our mandated responsibilities to promote access to international protection and solutions for individuals who need them, wherever they are.
However, these tactical objections help progressives hide their refusal to limit the potentially endless waves of asylum seekers at the U.S. borders.
For example, an article by Yael Schacher, a pro-migration advocate at Refugees International, cited a non-binding 1968 statement by President Lyndon Johnson that suggests all refugees have a right to work permits. Breitbart News asked her to describe some limits on migration. “The UN refugee convention and protocol [includes] the right to become self-supporting or the right to work,” said an evasive response from Schacher’s organization.
Similarly, Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin suggested December 7 that all foreigners — regardless of their numbers — have a right to live in the United States:


Immigration Numbers:

Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.
But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants. It also adds replacement workers to a resident population of more than 1.5 million white-collar visa workers — including approximately one million H-1B workers and about 500,000 blue-collar H-2B, H-2A, and J-1 visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners, and it rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.
This policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.

The federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children’s schools and college educations.
The cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.
The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.
But President Donald Trump’s “Hire American” policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy.
The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full-time, year-round work.",19-Nov-19

“The German interior ministry says that in fact last year 27 illegal migrants either committed or attempted to commit murder or manslaughter,” their article admonishes — but then goes on to say: “The 447 figure refers to killings or attempted killings by all asylum seekers and refugees, most of whom are in Germany legally.”
Essentially, the ‘fact-checkers’ confirm the AfD’s figures — offering only a semantic objection to von Storch’s decision to describe migrants who lodged asylum applications after arriving in Germany as “illegal” migrants.


The BBC team also boasts that “Overall crime in Germany has fallen to the lowest level since 1992” — but has to concede that “there has been an increase in migrant crime”.
The broadcaster admits that “violent crime rose from 180,000 cases to 193,000 between 2014 and 2016 [and the] number of murders increased by 14.6 percent and rapes by 8 percent, over the same period”.
They also concede that criminal suspects classified as “asylum applicants or civil war refugees or illegal immigrants” represented a total of 8.5 percent of all suspects in 2017, “despite their population representing just 2 percent of Germany as a whole”.
With respect to violent crime, this over-representation is even more pronounced, with migrants accounting for 10.4 percent of murder suspects and 11.9 percent of sexual offence suspects for the year.
Source: BBC Reality Check
However, the ‘fact-checkers’ go on to hint that the blame for this should be attributed to the fact that “Asylum seekers in Germany face bureaucratic hurdles before they’re allowed to find work, and while they receive some money from the state, it is limited.”
They also conclude their article by quoting a series of excuses for migrant over-representation in the crime statistics by left-leaning criminologist Dominic Kudlacek.
“They have social deprivation, they are alone and they spend most of their time with other people suffering from these risk factors — the accommodation of the majority of asylum seekers is like refugee camps with little privacy, which again can add to the likelihood of committing crimes,” he argues.
He also suggests that their over-representation is “because of the demographics”, as they are “younger than the average population and mostly male. Young men commit more crimes in every society.”
This appears to contradict the BBC’s typical portrait of migrants as either valuable doctors and engineers or vulnerable women and children fleeing danger, however.

An asylum home in the German city of Ludwigshafen, located across the Rhine river from Mannheim, has reported at least 59 confirmed coronavirus cases among residents, with the facility having a population of around 170.


The accommodation has been under quarantine measures since the start of April according to German tabloid Bild which said that infected migrants had been moved away from the facility.
The paper added that many migrants have been caught violating the quarantine measures and have been brought back to the facility by police officers in recent weeks.
In late March, German mayors in the towns of Schneeberg and Zschorlau complained that asylum seekers in migrant homes in their area were not respecting measures to halt the spread of coronavirus.

In neighbouring France, an asylum home in the commune of La Crèche confirmed that 38 migrants have tested positive for the Chinese virus, nearly half of the total population of the accommodation which houses 86 individuals of various nationalities.

The migrants, who live in a local hotel, were first tested last week. Authorities found nine of the migrants had confirmed cases of the virus. A follow-up test was then conducted and revealed the actual number of cases was much higher.
The migrants have now been placed in three different locations, two hotels and a local apprentice training campus, with no severe cases of the virus reported among the migrants so far.
Over 100 French leftist parliamentarians have proposed amnesty for illegal migrants and asylum seekers in order to combat the spread of coronavirus, arguing that they would then have better access to healthcare systems.
The MPs wrote a letter to French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to emulate a similar temporary measure enacted by Portugal in late March.

With the minimum basic monthly payment being $623 (£387), that equates to nearly $2.6 million (Canadian) per month for those 4,000 asylum seekers alone.
Employment Minister Francois Blais said recipients will have to undergo a “revenue test” to determine if they are eligible for the full amount, but advised that there are additional funds available depending on the recipient’s family status.
“Quebec has responsibilities in immigration,” Blais told a news conference.

“Now they’ll be getting welfare, they’ll be able to rent an apartment and get out of temporary accommodation, which is a good thing because it is pretty costly.”

The migrants travelled via an unofficial crossing point between New York and Quebec after left wing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau extended an open invitation to migrants following President Trump issuing an executive order temporarily halting U.S. refugee resettlement. At the time, Trudeau tweeted: “Diversity is our strength.  #WelcomeToCanada”
The move emulated German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s invitation to Middle Eastern and African migrants to come in unlimited numbers and resettle in Europe during the migrant crisis, which led to more than one million migrants entering the continent.
Prime Minister Trudeau has appeared to row back on the invitation, however, telling reporters this week: “For someone to successfully seek asylum it’s not about economic migration.”

“It’s about vulnerability, exposure to torture or death, or being stateless people. If they are seeking asylum we’ll evaluate them on the basis of what it is to be a refugee or asylum seeker,” he added.
Since the start of the year, more than 11,300 asylum seekers have crossed from the U.S. to Canada, nearly 7,000 arriving just since July alone.

Many of the migrants in Canada are from Haiti, who arrived in the U.S. following the 2010 earthquake. U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that up to 58,000 Haitians could be repatriated as the emergency they were fleeing has ended.
Struggling to cope with the mass numbers of migrant arrivals, Montreal’s Olympic Stadium had to be turned into an emergency asylum centre.
Last week, Breitbart London reported that several migrants crossing the border into Canada were found with child pornography.

One of the politicians demanding more asylum seekers is Stephan Neher, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), from the small town of Rottenburg am Neckar, which has a population of just 5,800 people but has taken in 850 refugees, Le Figaro reports.


Mr Neher said that he is waiting for the government in Berlin to give him the go-ahead to send a bus to Malta or the Italian island of Lampedusa to pick up migrants and bring them back to Rottenburg am Neckar, where a vacant building would allow 60 more migrants to live in the small town.

“Our city does not want to remain inactive and just watch people die simply because Europe does not respect the right to life. We, as a municipality, want to take our part in this challenge and make sure that we act in a human way,” he told Le Figaro. 

Several other cities, including Berlin, Freiburg, Cologne, and Dusseldorf, are also demanding to be able to take more asylum seekers and are asking that the federal government speed up the asylum procedure.
Social Democrat (SPD) mayor of Dusseldorf Thomas Geisel told the paper that there was “no choice” when it came to receiving more migrants, saying: “We do this in the name of fundamental humanitarian principles which are not negotiable. Rather, it is an appeal to the government which should be seen as an encouragement.”

One of the main opponents to the municipal and city governments has been former Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) leader and Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer who previously slammed the city of Potsdam for welcoming in unaccompanied minors.
Seehofer has been a critic of mass migration for years and called on Chancellor Merkel to enact a maximum quota for asylum seekers per year and nearly threatened to resign over migration issues in 2018.
The requests by the local governments come as Germany set a record for migrant spending in 2018, with 7.9 billion euros spent on various programmes and housing for asylum seekers and refugees.

The Delmi report examined cases of migrants who were refused residency or refugee status between 199 and 2018 and found that 45 per cent of the cases led to police becoming involved because the migrants had either disappeared or had to be forcibly removed from Sweden, Nyheter Idag reports.


Another 44 per cent of the cases saw the migrants leave Sweden voluntarily, while nine per cent had their deportation orders cancelled.
Delmi found that those who required deportation were given a low priority by the government despite various promises from politicians.
“Within both the Police and the Swedish Migration Board, the two authorities that are going to execute cases, the deportation issues are regarded as an ‘odd activity’, not really in line with the core mission, or what the staff would prefer to do,” the report states.


The authors of the report also note that the many chances for migrants to appeal deportation orders has led to migrants and government officials not treating deportation orders as the final say in many cases saying appeals, “send signals through the system that a no is not always a no.”
The report comes just days after a member of the Swedish parliament belonging to the Left Party encouraged Swedes to hide migrants who were at risk of deportation from law enforcement officials.
Left Party MP Daniel Riazat wrote on Facebook, “My message to all who can: Hide a refugee. If it becomes illegal. Hide two! It’s called Civil Courage and Humanity!”
Earlier this year, a member of the ruling Social Democrats was arrested after a Swedish newspaper discovered that he had helped facilitate illegal migration into the country, selling passport documents for as much as 3,000 euros for adults and 2,000 euros for children.

The European Commission has already begun legal action against Greece, Croatia and Italy for failing to implement the Eurodac Regulation, which mandates fingerprinting asylum seekers and cataloguing the data within 72 hours of their entry into the country.
In recent months, hundreds of thousands of migrants have arrived in Europe, causing tensions among the EU states.
Nevertheless, at a book presentation in Milan Monday, EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos publicly praised the swift response to the problem by Italian Minister of the Interior Angelino Alfano. “Italy is now moving quickly and I want to publicly praise Alfano,” he said.

“All these countries were caught by surprise” by exceptional migratory flows, Avramopoulos said, while underscoring the urgency of a quicker response.
Alfano said that Italy has already taken “nearly 100% percent” of fingerprints of asylum seekers, and moreover that the Italian Supreme Court had handed down its own rulings “authorizing the use of proportionate force to collect fingerprints.”
Italy and Greece, who have borne the brunt of the waves of migrants landing on European shores, have expressed their grievances with the EU over the perceived lack of support and understanding for their predicament. They have also been accused of a passive-aggressive reaction, in allowing large numbers of asylum seekers to simply pass through the country to register elsewhere in Europe.
According to EU statistics released last Thursday, a total of 812,705 people claimed asylum in the EU bloc in the first nine months of 2015.
The EU Commission stated that “despite the substantial encouragement” of the Commission, “only one of the six designated hotspot is fully operational, in Lampedusa,” adding their expectation that two more centers in Pozzallo and Porto Empedocle will be fully operational in the coming days.”
For his part, Alfano responded that the new registration hotspots are insufficient in themselves. “The strategic plan of the EU is made ​​of hotspots and also the relocation of refugees. So it is clear that we must open hotspots but it is also clear that the redeployment should work,” he said.
Alfano also said that he considered the procedures against Italy “unjust and unreasonable” but expressed his hope that the rest of Europe will come to understand the problem as Italy understands it, because “we are right,” he said.
“We think Europe should be thanking us,” he said.

The decision on the scheme, which also covers a further 22,504 Syrian refugees yet to enter Europe,  has been postponed until the end of the year.The distribution scheme was originally proposed by the European Commission in May after the deaths of over 700 migrants on a shipwrecked boat crossing from Libya to Italy in April.

At a summit in June EU leaders called for an agreement to be finalised by the end of July but after yesterday’s meeting EU home affairs ministers could only agree to commit to the relocation of 32,256 Syrians, Eritreans, Iraqis and Somalis beginning in October.
The Telegraph reports ministers also agreed to relocate a further 22,504 Syrians currently housed in refugee camps outside the EU.

EU Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said: “We are almost there. The remaining 8,000 will be allocated by the end of this year, by December. I’m disappointed this did not happen today, but it was a very important step forward.”

EurActiv reports that while Spain and Poland were among the staunchest opponents of the plan, others committed to taking fewer migrants than requested, or rejected them fully. According to The Telegraph the countries most reluctant to admit migrants were Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Baltic countries and Spain. Accepting 1,900 migrants Austria’s Interior Minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, refused to commit to any asylum seekers, saying:
“Austria has become the first target country and deals with 10 times more asylum seekers’ application than Greece and Italy put together and this cannot be right.”
Spain’s Minister of the Interior, Jorge Fernandez Diaz, criticised the plan which requested he commit to accepting 4,300 migrants. He warned it will “create a pull factor” which will attract more migrants to Europe rather than stopping them from risking the sea crossing. He did, however, commit to Spain taking 1,300 migrants.
Rihards Kozlovskis, Latvia’s interior minister, said his country was reluctant to admit migrants for fear of a potential surge from nearby Ukraine. He offered to accept 200 asylum seekers and 50 migrants.
Hungary has received the EU’s highest number of asylum applications in the first quarter of 2015, according to European Union data, and was allowed an exemption from taking any asylum seekers.
The BBC reports Germany offered most places – 10,500 for asylum seekers and 1,600 for migrants – followed by France with 6,752 and 2,375 respectively. EU treaties allow the UK, Denmark and Ireland to opt out of the programme, nevertheless Ireland agreed to take 600 asylum seekers and 520 migrants while Denmark and Britain agreed to accept 1,000 and 2,200 migrants, but no asylum seekers.

The need to reach a deal is now becoming critical, as member states need to turn their attention to a second migration front.
As reported by Breitbart London yesterday the number of migrants making the land crossing over the Balkan peninsula into Central Europe is soon expected to outnumber those entering the EU by sea. Already the spike in immigration crossing from Serbia into Hungary has prompted that country’s unilateral decision to erect a border fence.

34-year-old Green League politician Maria Ohisalo, who serves as Minister of the Interior under 34-year-old Social Democratic party leader Sanna Marin in a red-green left-wing coalition government, said Finland was following the common European Union line to “reject Turkey’s attempts to use people as political pawns” — but also said that the Greek government’s decision to suspend asylum applications was “wrong”.


The Greeks have been faced with huge pressure at their land border with Turkey, where thousands of migrants have massed, facilitated by transport provided by the Turkish authorities.
The migrants have been making violent sallies against Greek border forces for days, often under cover of tear gas fire on the Greek lines by Turkish personnel — although the Turks claim this has only been in response to the Greeks firing tear gas at them.


But despite going along with the official EU-mandated line of support for the Greek government and committing to “sending a four-guard unit to take part in a rapid border intervention operation” on the Greek border, according to public broadcaster Yle, the Finnish government has also denounced the Greek government’s decision to suspend asylum applications — and suggested any Finnish personnel on the ground will “try to support Greece” by receiving asylum seekers.
“The Finnish government’s position here is clear. When we secure our borders, we are abiding by international obligations. International obligations include [observing] the right to apply for asylum. This is one of the areas where we will try to support Greece,” said Maria Ohisalo.
Danish personnel operating in Greek waters with Frontex, the European Union Border and Coast Guard Agency, have already boasted of having defied orders from Greek senior officers to turn back illegal migrants arriving in Greek territorial waters by sea, instead bringing them to the Greek island of Kos.

The Finns Party — formerly the True Finns — is calling for a vote of no confidence in the left-wing government over its contradictory position on the border crisis, which was further complicated by finance minister Katri Kulmuni, 32.
Kulumni, filling in for the prime minister — who had jetted off to New York to attend United Nations events marking International Women’s Day — stated: “We support Greece in ensuring its external borders hold. Connected to this is the fact that international law and human rights must be observed.”
The Finns Party deemed that this amounted to obfuscating the government’s position, as supporting Greece’s efforts to hold its border while also insisting on its supposed obligations to receive people claiming to be asylum seekers are mutually exclusive positions.
For its part, the Finnish government has insisted it will not turn away any migrants who arrive at its own border.

“I welcome the migrants, asylum seekers and refugees who, together with the workers from Caritas Italy and other Catholic organizations, are the sign of a Church that tries to be open, inclusive and welcoming,” Francis said.
After thanking members of the group for their “untiring service,” the pontiff asked the thousands gathered in the Square to offer them a “big round of applause.”
“With your daily life,” he said, “you remind us that Christ himself asks us to welcome our brother and sister migrants and refugees with arms wide open.”

“That’s right, with arms wide open,” Francis continued, “ready for a sincere, affectionate and encompassing embrace, kind of like this Colonnade of Saint Peter’s Square, which represents the church as mother embracing everyone, sharing in the common journey.” The Pope was referring to the rows of columns flanking Saint Peter’s Square like two open arms, designed by Italian artist and architect Gianlorenzo Bernini.
The Pope ended his appeal by greeting representatives of a number of other organizations engaged in providing assistance to migrants and refugees.
Along with Caritas, these groups have pledged their support in “gathering signatures petitioning for a new immigration law, more relevant for the current circumstances,” Francis said.
Last week, the Pope urged European nations to welcome more migrants throughout the continent, telling his hearers to beware of the “intolerance, discrimination and xenophobia” that have sprung up around Europe.
Speaking with directors of the Church’s pastoral work with migrants, the Pope recognized the malaise caused by the “massive migrant flows” in Europe that have “thrown into crisis migratory policies held up to now.”
At the same time, he rejected national immigration policies designed to protect the cultural and religious identities of the peoples of Europe.
“I won’t hide my concern in the face of the signs of intolerance, discrimination and xenophobia that have arisen in different regions of Europe,” the pontiff said, which are “often fueled by reticence and fear of the other, the one who is different, the foreigner.”
“I am worried still more by the sad awareness that our Catholic communities in Europe are not exempt from these reactions of defensiveness and rejection, justified by an unspecified ‘moral duty’ to conserve one’s original cultural and religious identity,” he said.

Mr Vuleta said that his doctoral forensic sociology research, which looks at people who have debts registered with Sweden’s government debt collection agency Kronofogden, has revealed that young migration-background men aged 18 to 25 account for 47 per cent of debtors, SVT reports.


Two-thirds of these men are said to have both low education levels and low rates of personal income as well.
Vuleta explained that the data reveals signs that the young men are becoming segregated from the rest of Swedish society, saying, “If you live in segregated areas, you are more likely to end up in social exclusion, which in turn can lead to financial exclusion.”


The average debt for those in the 18 to 25 age group currently sits at 42,000 Swedish Krona (£3,416/4,438), up by 40 per cent since 2010.
Debts will be less likely to be collected from migration-background young men, on average, due to the much higher unemployment rate for such individuals in Sweden.
A report in 2019 noted that 90 per cent of the migrants who came to Sweden during the height of the 2015 migrant crisis and received permanent residency were also unemployed.
Professor and economist Per Lundborg floated the idea of creating more jobs that do not require advanced education or training to help get migrants into the labour force.
“Sweden is one of the most high-tech countries in the world, where we streamline simpler jobs. Therefore, the knowledge gap is too large for many of the refugee immigrants who come here,” he said.

Questioning why the migrants coming to the UK were being called asylum seekers despite fleeing France, a relatively peaceful Western democracy, Mr Javid said: “A question has to be asked: if you are a genuine asylum seeker, why have you not sought asylum in the first safe country you arrived in?”

The Times reports he said: “Because France is not a country where anyone would argue it is not safe in anyway whatsoever, and if you are genuine then why not seek asylum in your first safe country?”

During the visit the home secretary met UK Border Force officers on the cutter HMC Searcher, the lone Border Force ship in UK waters. Her three sister ships are deployed to the Mediterranean, one of them stationed at Gibraltar.
The home secretary also stepped up his rhetoric on assessing asylum cases, telling television crews on the quayside that while they would be judged in the “normal way”, the British government would work to discourage others following.

Mr Javid said: “If you do somehow make it to the UK, we will do everything we can to make sure that you are often not successful because we need to break that link, and to break that link means we can save more lives.”
The comments triggered instant outrage from migration activists who were widely quoted in the British press attacking the home secretary trying to dissuade would-be migrants from putting their lives at risk in the English Channel, the busiest shipping lane in the world.

The Guardian, which also slammed Javid for calling the Channel boat migrants “illegal migrants”, reported several such voices including Refugee Council boss Dr Lisa Doyle.

The advocate said: “The 1951 refugee convention acknowledges that refugees may enter countries through irregular routes and should not be penalised for this… The outcome of an asylum application cannot be pre-judged, irrespective of how that person reached the country.
“It’s a shame that the home secretary seems to need reminding that seeking asylum is a right and the UK has an obligation to assess claims fairly and grant protection to those who need it.”
Labour’s Stella Creasy accused Javid of pretending to “play tough for votes”.",2-Jan-19

“We have taken a long period of time to look at the biometrics and look at individual cases,” Mr. Dutton told Sky News.
“We have excluded a large number of cases and I think we have ended up with people who are deserving of support, who were targeted by the IS particularly in Syria and Iraq. We’ve chosen people who will make a big contribution and who will want to educate their kids and integrate into Australian society.”
“We should be very pleased and proud as a nation that we have been able to help,” he said, claiming that Australian government has placed an emphasis on sheltering refugees from the Middle East’s embattled Christian and Yazidi minorities.

“We were very clear when we set up this programme that we wanted to concentrate on persecuted minorities. Like the Yazidi women who have watched family members slaughtered, their sisters and daughters abducted and murdered these are genuine refugees.”
Australia has experienced a number of terror events since Islamic State proclaimed a worldwide caliphate under Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in June 2014.
In September 2014, Abdul Numan Haider stabbed two police counter-terrorism officers in Endeavour Hills, Melbourne.
In December 2014 Iranian migrant Man Haron Monis took 18 people hostage in a Sydney cafe, killing one after a long stand-off before armed police stormed the premises.
In October 2015 Iranian-born Farhad Khalil Mohammad Jabar shot and killed an unarmed police support worker at the News South Wales Police headquarters in Paramatta.

The paper’s political editor Marcel Leubecher made the admission in an editorial article for the paper this week, noting the rise of migrants crossing into Europe both into Italy across the Mediterranean and across the Aegean sea into Greece.


“Contrary to popular belief, the majority of those arriving in Italy are not refugees. The main countries of origin for boat migrants in January were Algeria, Ivory Coast, and Bangladesh,” Leubecher wrote.
He went on to note that 95 per cent of the asylum applications from the aforementioned countries were rejected and that Libyans made up hardly any of the asylum seekers who arrived in Europe despite their country being in the middle of civil conflict.
According to Italian Interior Ministry data, while the highest number of migrants set out to Italy from Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and even Turkey saw large numbers of migrants set sail for Italy from their shores as well.


While many of the migrants coming into Europe are unable to claim asylum or refugee status, a high number remain in Europe, despite orders to deport them.
In 2018, the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) admitted that only a small fraction of failed African asylum seekers have actually been deported from the country and most have a high possibility of never being deported at all.
Even when migrants have been deported, many of them simply return to Europe. A total of 28,283 migrants are known to have returned to Germany since 2012 after being deported, 5,000 of which have done so on multiple occasions.
Other countries like the UK have not fared better when it comes to deporting illegal failed asylum seekers. According to a report released last month, just 15 per cent of migrants coming into Britain illegally are actually sent back to their country of origin.

The CBS Evening News broadcast reported that the “mass exodus organized by activists in Honduras is believed to be the largest migrant caravan on record, an estimated 7,200 people, five times the size of the last one in April.”
Correspondent Adriana Diaz added: “Most tell us they are fleeing extreme poverty, but that’s not a condition for asylum or refugee status in the U.S.”


On CNN on Tuesday afternoon, correspondent Bill Weir interviewed a migrant who told him bluntly that “we are workers.” Weir interviewed another migrant and found out he was a former taxi driver who was leaving behind his children “because there’s no job” in Honduras.
NBC News also recently interviewed a migrant who the outlet revealed was hoping “to reach the U.S. and find work to send money back home.”
President Donald Trump has vowed to cut off foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador if they do not stop caravans from traveling to the United States. At a Wednesday evening Wisconsin rally, Trump again said pro-amnesty Democrats and activist judges are preventing his administration “from returning illegal aliens back home to Central America and other parts of the world.” At a Monday Texas rally, Trump said the migrant caravan “is an assault on our country.”
Last week on CNN, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum pointed out that Trump’s America-first message on economics and immigration is resonating with blue-collar workers of all backgrounds.
Santorum said that he thinks “the fundamental misunderstanding the left has with the immigration issue is they see it as a race issue. And it’s not a race issue.”
“It’s not a race issue with the people who are listening to Donald Trump… it’s an economic issue,” he said. “They see immigration as low-wage workers coming into this country, depressing wages, taking jobs, and it affects disproportionally, and this is why the president talks about it, and actually thinks it’s a good thing from the standpoint of race, because it does disproportionally affect people of color.”
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly emphasized that illegal immigration hurts Latinos and black Americans who are trying to move up the economic ladder.
“Look at his numbers among African-Americans, look at his numbers among Hispanics. You think there is no way a man who says some of the outrageous things he does say when it comes to race, yet he’s getting decent numbers there,” Santorum continued. “Why? Because they see immigration as dealing with their job.”",24-Oct-18

Swedish authorities are facing a real problem with migrants set for deportations due to the fact that borders around the globe have not only been closed and policies which limit the amount of time migrants can be held in detention.


Ulrica Granberg, the head of the Border Police in the district of Bergslagen, has sounded the alarm, saying that detention centres are packed with migrants awaiting deportation but many will have to be released, Sveriges Radio reports.
According to Granberg, at least four people have been released since borders closed due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Sweden will likely be faced with the real possibility many of the freed migrants will go into hiding, a fact Granberg admitted, saying: “There is probably an imminent risk, yes.”


 
 
Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, Sweden still had major issues with facilitating deportations of illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers with a report from the Migration Studies Delegation (Delmi) in early February stating the government had made deportations a low priority.
“Within both the Police and the Swedish Migration Board, the two authorities that are going to execute cases, the deportation issues are regarded as an ‘odd activity’, not really in line with the core mission, or what the staff would prefer to do,” the report said.
Swedish Migration Board Director-General Mikael Ribbenvik went even further, saying the current Swedish asylum rules allow potential terrorists and war criminals to remain in Sweden even if they fail their asylum claims.
“Today we have a regulatory framework which means that in many cases they can stay in Sweden on roughly the same conditions as others and, in addition, move freely in and out of the country,” he said.
Swedish Left Party MP Daniel Riazat even recommended the public hide migrants up for deportation from the police, saying: “My message to all who can: Hide a refugee. If it becomes illegal. Hide two! It’s called Civil Courage and Humanity!”

The ECJ ruled that the decision to remove the Afghan, even if just temporarily, was a violation of EU law and that a 2013 regulation on refugees banned such penalities for offences, even if they were violent.

The court went on to say that basic needs for asylum seekers must be met, “permanently and without interruption,” and said it was not good enough that the asylum home gave the migrant a list of homeless shelters he could visit.
While the judges on the court banned the action of the asylum home, they said it was still permissible for EU member states to imprison migrants for offences or to move them to other asylum accommodations.

Belgium, like Germany, Sweden and other countries, has seen a large influx of migrants since the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, which led to criticism earlier this year by Belgian Senator Alain Destexhe who claimed that elites in the country did not forecast the consequences of allowing in so many migrants.
“A large part of the immigrant population is not integrated, neither economically (it depends strongly on the social system), nor culturally, which is even more serious: they live according to value systems that are sometimes incompatible with our laws, our history, and our traditions,” he said.
Crime in asylum homes is also common across Europe. In Germany, it was claimed in March that police in rural Boostedt were covering up the extent of crime in local asylum seeker housing in order to not “stir up prejudice.”

With the looming Mexican presidential elections on July 1, candidates like the leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador — who is expected to win — vows to demilitarize the immigration enforcement, National Public Radio (NPR) reports.
In a speech last Tuesday, Obrador declared:
After the victory of our movement, we will defend all migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world. … Military and police force will not be used to repress the [migrant] population. We will primarily use diplomatic channels with the origin countries of these migrants to reach some kind of agreement.
Until then, Central Americans seeking refuge in Mexico are facing various human rights violations not only by criminal groups who demand payment just for passing through but also at the hands of immigration officials accused of using “a secret quota system” to increase the number of deportations.

The Guardian reported in April:
A growing number of indigenous Mexicans are being detained and threatened with expulsion by immigration agents looking for undocumented Central American migrants. The trend comes amid a crackdown on migrants driven in part by political pressure and financial aid from the US.
Deportations have already risen exponentially since summer 2014 when Barack Obama declared the surge in Central American child migrants a humanitarian crisis. Campaigners say that Mexico migration officials are running a secret quota system to increase the number of expulsions.
Activists say that Mexico’s National Immigration Institute is increasingly operating like an unchecked police force – and say that that like the country’s security forces, it appears to be systematically using torture against detainees.
Gretchen Kuhener, director of the Institute for Women in Migration (IMUMI), described the quota system allegedly employed by immigration agents as “racist.”
While Mexico blasted U.S. President Donald Trump’s “zero-tolerance” policy on undocumented as “cruel and inhuman,” Mexican immigration authorities were engaging in various human rights violations when dealing with prospective refugees from Central America, human rights NGOs report. Mexico has also “improperly” returned “asylum seekers to their countries of persecution” in violation of international law and suppressing asylum claims by Central American, the Guardian and Human Rights First report.
According to the Doctors Without Borders groups, known as MSF for its French name, Mexico has failed to protect asylum-seeking women and children, identified as especially vulnerable, from violence within its borders.
Over the last five years, asylum claims have reportedly increased more than ten-fold from 1,296 in 2013 to 14,596 last year, the most recent data available.

Of those who applied last year, Mexico only approved less than 15 percent (1,907), the Associated Press (AP) reported in January, stressing that Mexico is forcing Central Americans back to their violence-stricken countries.
In March, Human Rights First noted:
Since July 2017, the dangers facing refugees and migrants in Mexico have escalated. Recent reports confirm that Mexican authorities continue to improperly return asylum seekers to their countries of persecution and that the deficiencies in the Mexican asylum system have grown.

…

The Mexican government is obligated [by international law] to prevent the return (refoulement) of any person to a country where they would face ongoing threats of persecution or torture. Human Rights First found that Mexico deports many refugees who are blocked or discouraged from seeking asylum in Mexico, or who do not even know they can apply for asylum. Subsequent reports indicate that these practices, which lead to the return of refugees to their countries of persecution, continue.
Mexico is not expected to devote additional money to its refugee programs to accommodate the growing number of refugees expected to reach its borders in the next few months, in response to crime, violence, and unstable governments in places like Nicaragua and Venezuela.
“Mexico has not invested in its refugee program,” José Knippen, the chief of the immigration and refugee program at the Mexico City think tank Fundar, told NPR.
Sister Magdalena Silva, who runs the migrant shelter, reportedly indicated, “the Mexican government’s refugee assistance agency has a 2018 budget of just $1.3 million and only has 15 protection agents in the entire country responsible for making decisions on more than 7,000 pending asylum claim.”
She added, “There are never enough resources for Central Americans fleeing [the] violence.”",25-Jun-18

A further 9,970 migrants receive money to study in Sweden, while another 18,405 are on municipal welfare programmes. Eight of the ten municipalities which took in the most migrants per population in 2015 also have unemployment rates far above the national average, Aftonbladet reports.
The municipality of Ljusnarsberg took in the most migrants per population, 230 per 1,000 people, and currently has an unemployment rate of over ten per cent.
Professor and economist Per Lundborg said the solution to the problem is to create more jobs that do not require large amounts of training or education.

“Sweden is one of the most high-tech countries in the world, where we streamline simpler jobs. Therefore, the knowledge gap is too large for many of the refugee immigrants who come here,” Lundborg noted.
“Sweden is a high-cost country. It is expensive to live here. If you then have a group that does not meet their living expenses through the work they do, they must still go to the society for help with their livelihood,” he added.
The figures come only days after the European Union statistics agency Eurostat revealed that Sweden was now 24th out of 28 member states in terms of unemployment.
Figures released last year showed a stark contrast between the native Swedish unemployment rate and the foreign-born unemployment rate. As a result, many municipalities which took in a high number of asylum seekers in 2015 have recently announced major financial troubles, some on the verge of bankruptcy.
Germany, which took in the most asylum seekers during the 2015 crisis, has seen similar problems getting migrants into work. A 2017 report claimed that the district of Salzlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt had a migrant unemployment rate of 96.3 per cent.

Top EU diplomats have also sounded the alarm over the number of illegal migrants flooding into Europe through the Mediterranean route.
“In most of the cases, and that is actually the case on the central Mediterranean route, we’re talking clearly and manifestly about economic migrants,” an EU official said earlier this week during a press conference.
“They get to Europe illegally, they do not have any documents which would allow them to enter the European soil,” the official added.

The official then clarified what Mr. Tusk wrote in his letter saying: “What Tusk stressed is the importance of looking at the rate of returns. This is somewhere where the progress still hasn’t been sufficient.”
Many countries, most notably Germany, have had an increasingly difficult time deporting illegal migrants or failed asylum seekers to countries in Africa due to a lack of cooperation from foreign governments as many migrants arrive with no papers.
The official noted that further cooperation with the Libyan government was paramount in tackling the crisis. “They could be our most important ally on the central Mediterranean route and we should make everything we can so that they work robustly against the smugglers and clearly on our side,” he said.
Most of the migrants rescued at sea are rescued by ships with European flags, many of them belonging to pro-migrant NGOs, and take the migrants to Europe, rather than back to North Africa. Many have slammed the NGOs claiming they are working intentionally with people traffickers as they wait for boats only miles off the Libyan coast.
Some politicians, like Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, have called for the EU to strengthen its presence in the Mediterranean. “As long as they rescuing people in the Mediterranean also means a ticket to Europe, more will come, ” he said adding, “we decide who is coming and going, not the people smugglers.”

The UN Refugee Agency stated that the Greek government’s move to suspend new asylum claims, a measure announced after Turkey opened the gates to all migrants last Thursday, had no legal basis, in a press release this week.


“Neither the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees nor EU refugee law provides any legal basis for the suspension of the reception of asylum applications,” the agency said.
They added that while Greece has invoked article 78(3) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU, which allows member states to “adopt provisional measures” when faced with “a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries”, they claim Greece cannot suspend the right of migrants to seek asylum.
“Persons entering irregularly on the territory of a State should also not be punished if they present themselves without delay to the authorities to seek asylum,” they said.


The group also added that not all of the migrants on the Greek border were Syrian, stating that there were also Afghans, Iranians, Sudanese, and others among the migrants.
Just days ago, Turkish interior minister Süleyman Soylu claimed that over 100,000 migrants had left Turkey and headed into Greece, although the numbers were disputed by the Greek government.
The European Union border agency Frontex has also signalled significant concern that the situation along the border could deteriorate as more migrants arrive.
The agency noted it will be “difficult to stop the massive flow of people who have travelled”, but had sent just 60 Frontex border guards to the area.
Violent tensions between the migrants and Greek border guards have also emerged in the days since the Turkish announcement to open the border, with migrants throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at Greek authorities.

Government spokesman Stelios Petsas commented on the footage, which was released by BBC World Service journalist Mughira Al Sharif on Monday, stating on social media platform Twitter that the alleged killing of a Syrian refugee was Turkish propaganda.


“Video showing fatality on Greek-Turkish border is fake news. We call upon everyone to use caution when reporting news that furthers Turkish propaganda,” Petsas said.
The footage claims that the man in the video is a Syrian asylum seeker named Ahmed Abu Emad who is originally from the city of Aleppo. Mr Al Sharif went on to state that the incident occurred on Monday morning at 9:07 am and the Syrian died after being shot in the throat. The true facts of the case have yet to emerge.


The footage comes as tensions remain high along the land border between Turkey and Greece after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that the country would be opening the gates to any and all asylum seekers and migrants who wished to travel to Europe on Thursday.
Since Thursday, there has been a huge surge of asylum seekers heading toward Greece, with Turkish Interior Minister  Süleyman Soylu claiming on Sunday that 100,577 migrants had left Turkey to head for Europe.
President Erdogan confirmed initial reports that the border was open for asylum seekers on Saturday saying, “We will not close the gates to refugees,” and added, “The European Union has to keep its promises.”
A video released by the Greek coastguard on Monday also claimed to show a migrant boat being escorted to Greece by a Turkish patrol craft. If proven true, the footage could add credence to claims that migrants travelling from the Turkish interior to the border with Germany are being assisted by the Turkish state railways and long-distance buses.
In response to the allegations, the Greek government released a statement saying, “Turkey, instead of curbing migrant and refugee smuggling networks, has become a smuggler itself.”
Clashes between migrants and Greek border guards have also occurred over the last several days, with migrants accused of throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at border officials.

He warned Europe that it will have prepare to shoulder its part of the migrant “burden.”


“After we opened the doors, there were multiple calls saying ‘close the doors’,” he said. “I told them ‘it’s done. It’s finished. The doors are now open. Now, you will have to take your share of the burden’.”
Some 13,000 migrants, including Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis, massed at Turkey’s border with Greece over the weekend after Erdogan announced Turkey would no longer prevent them from heading towards Europe’s hearland.
The move follows years of threats made by Erdogan to punish Europe for not furnishing his Islamist government with money and political support by opening Turkey’s borders — behind which are 3.5 million or more migrants waiting to travel to head west.

As Breitbart London reported, tensions at the border with Turkey began rising as thousands of migrants arrived at the frontier on unmarked buses and state-owned railways.
Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced on Sunday evening that all asylum applications are being suspended in response to the crisis, and “the level of deterrence at our borders [has been increased to the maximum.”
E.U. foreign ministers are due to meet this week at the request of Greece to discuss the situation, amid fears of a repeat of the refugee influx that poisoned European politics in 2015.
Athens is to boost patrols of its land and sea borders in the north-east and was also suspending consideration of asylum applications by those who entered the country illegally, said Greek government spokesman, Stelios Petsas.

Suicide threats and self-immolation are becoming increasingly common among migrants waiting to enter the country.“This is another distressing incident,” Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said in response to the news that a third Tamil migrant had set himself on fire. The 40-year-old man is said to have poured gas on his legs and ignited himself in a home in Melbourne. He had been awaiting an extension on his temporary visa.


The incident followed a similar incident two days prior, when a 29-year-old died after committing self-immolation in Melbourne, as well. That man, Leo Seemanpillai, had been waiting more than a year for a determination on his refugee status after fleeing Sri Lanka. He was diagnosed as depressed, and Morrison told the press that “there was no indication” he would be sent back to Sri Lanka.

A similar incident occurred in April with an unnamed man, who survived burning 75% of his body.
The events are prompting a national conversation on the treatment of immigrants and asylum-seekers in Australia. According to the Herald Sun, while self-immolation remains uncommon, many workers at immigration centers report that those waiting for news on their migrant status are often depressed and contemplate suicide. The paper reports that the number of asylum-seekers threatening physical harm at aid centers for migrants has increased five-fold. Asylum Seeker Resource Centre CEO Kon Karapanagiotidis told the paper that he hears stories of migrants threatening suicide “on a weekly basis.” He explained, “The reason why is because (this) is a community with a deep sense of fear of being returned home to torture and harm, a community in great crisis, a community left in limbo with no hope.”
The Australian government, currently working to remedy a federal budget crisis, is attempting to reduce the number of migrants and refugees seeking permanent residence in the country. This has led them to open centers in which migrants must live before their immigration status becomes official, many cramped and overpopulated, in nearby Papua New Guinea. Human rights groups have flagged the immigration centers as potentially problematic; interviews with children that the Australian Human Rights Commission conducted there found that the children, who were very unhappy, described the place as “hell” and were demanding to leave.",23-Jun-14

“These are refugees using legal routes to seek & apply for asylum,” Ocasio-Cortez said of the caravan. “At this point, if you are an outlet adopting the president’s language to describe this as a ‘caravan,’ you‘re playing yourself. And letting him play you.”
In another post online, Ocasio-Cortez criticized NBC News for noting the border crossings have risen in the last year, saying: “Repeating Trump’s rhetoric without fact-check is completely irresponsible, especially in a time of rising white supremacist violence.”



Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks encouraging Central Americans to come to the U.S. to seek asylum come as migrants with the caravan have repeatedly admitted that they are ineligible for asylum, as Breitbart News reported, and caravan organizers have disparaged “white voters” in America and noted that the migration is a “mass exodus” to the U.S.
The caravan of migrants is made up of primarily job-seekers and previously deported illegal aliens, neither of which make the Central Americans eligible for asylum in the U.S.
“It’s time for me to go back to the United States. It’s a country where I can live my life, unlike Guatemala,” 36-year-old Job Reyes told the Washington Post. Reyes was deported from the U.S. after over-staying his visa for 14 years.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has encouraged the mass migration from Central America, remarking that Americans should be “welcoming” and “tolerant” to mass immigration and caravans.

Ocasio-Cortez has made similar comments in the past. Months ago, the self-proclaimed socialist said that illegal aliens deserve a “right of passage” to freely enter the country.

Less than six months ago, a similar migrant caravan was allowed to cross into the U.S. with weak asylum claims despite threats from President Trump to close down the border. Many migrants from that caravan are now illegal aliens living in the U.S. as they await their asylum hearings.
Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that states can stop the “invasion” of the caravan by taking advantage of their constitutional “war powers” that give them the unique ability to readily turn foreign nationals away without going through lengthy court proceedings.

This is not the first time that migrants have set the pavilion ablaze. Similar acts of arson occurred in 2009 and then in 2011.


After hours battling the fire, which was set around 10:30pm, teams of firefighters stationed on the island were finally able to get the blaze under control in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

“The situation is unclear. But luckily all the guests are safe, no one was hurt,” said the director of the center, Rossana Perri.
The four Tunisian migrants suspected of starting the fire were stopped as they walked away from the pavilion moments after the building went up in flames. The property, which had been rebuilt after the first two fires, is seriously damaged.
On Tuesday two separate groups of Tunisian migrants had landed on the small island, which as Italy’s southernmost point is only 70 miles by sea from the African nation of Tunisia. In the morning of a group of 14 Tunisians arrived, followed by another 35 who were picked up by the Italian Coast Guard later in the day.
Reports suggest that in recent weeks tensions had already been growing inside the Lampedusa welcome center, linked to the refusal by a group of African migrants, mainly from Eritrea and Yemen, to submit to identification and registration procedures including the taking of fingerprints.
During this time, dozens of the migrants had held a protest in the main town square in front of the Church, camping out and staging a hunger strike that lasted four days.

 Merkel has spearheaded Germany’s response to the greatest influx of refugees into Europe since the Second World War, with Germany taking nearly half of all asylum applications made by Syrians in EU member states last year.
After the 40-minute meeting, Clooney criticized the U.S. policy toward migrants on German television. “You know in the United States, we aren’t doing enough,” he said. “We are a little less involved than we should be.”
Later Friday, the Clooneys, who are in Germany to promote the actor’s new film Hail, Caesar, also visited a Berlin refugee shelter. He had said he wished to meet a group of asylum seekers, “to talk about and ask what messages and what things we can do… to help.”

The Clooneys’ public statements about immigration stand in odd juxtaposition to reports from northern Italy over the past year suggesting that the couple has found their $10 million Lake Como property to be too public.
The 18th-century estate, which is reportedly now worth ten times what Clooney paid for it, or $100 million, is in a very exclusive area. But local mayor Roberto Pozzi still had to make extra efforts to guarantee the actor’s privacy last April and imposed a $600 fine for anyone found trespassing on or around the actor’s property.
Though many find it glamorous to have Clooney as a neighbor some, like local fisherman Livio de’ Angeli, resent the restrictions imposed to ensure the actor’s privacy.
“I used to be able to leave my car here on the ramp leading down to the water, but now I can’t—I’d get fined by the police,” the man said. “You’re not allowed to park anywhere near the villa and you can’t take a boat within 100 meters of the house. It’s like living in a mini dictatorship.”
According to one source, Clooney loves his estate and the area, but he has received a huge offer for the villa, which he is considering, and “he would buy another, less accessible property in another area of Italy.”

If the agency does not check the status by the third year the individuals are given permanent residency Die Welt reports.


So far this year BAMF has revoked the refugee status of only 206 individuals despite there being 107,000 potential cases for them to review over the same period.
Only 1,552 migrants with refugee status were actually examined this year to see if their status as refugees was still applicable.
The number of revocations of refugee status has gone down in recent years with last year seeing only 240 cases. BAMF has blamed the 2015 migrant crisis which has greatly stretched the resources of the agency.

Politician Armin Schuster, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic  Union (CDU) slammed the agency saying, “if the BAMF rarely checks whether a refugee still needs protection at all, and we grant him a legal entitlement to an unlimited residence permit after only three years, we make the right to asylum the right to immigration.”
“In the next governing coalition, we have to change that by permitting permanent residence permits to be issued only after six years, and the BAMF having to first check whether the reason for the flight is still ongoing,” he added.

Even if an individual has their refugee status revoked by the agency it does not mean they will be deported from the country. Germany is host to many failed asylum seekers it either refuses to deport or is unable for a number of reasons.
Since the Berlin terror attack, which was committed by failed asylum seeker Anis Amri, there have been several other high profile cases involving failed asylum seekers. The most recent occurred earlier this week when a failed asylum seeker from Pakistan allegedly murdered his two-year-old daughter and fled from authorities.

The projection claims that at least 23,000 asylum seekers are expected to come to Sweden this year, up from the 21,958 who applied for asylum in 2019, with Migration Board planning manager Henrik Holmer labelling the estimate a “fairly marginal increase”.


The Migration Board noted that there has been an increase in migrant traffic in the Balkan region, particularly with more and more migrants entering Greece in recent months, SVT reports.

In December, Greek government commissioner for the initial reception of refugees Manos Logothetis predicted that Greece could see as many as 100,000 migrant arrivals this year, as camps on Greek islands like Lesbos and Samos continue to operate far above capacity.

The Swedish migration board noted that Turkish policies in northern Syria, such as wanting to move a million Syrians back to Syria, could also have an effect on the number of new asylum seekers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently threatened the European Union over the issue, demanding money to help rehouse Syrians or he would “open the gates” for potentially millions of migrants to head to Europe.
While most of the new arrivals in Sweden are expected to come from countries like Syria and others in the region, the Migration Board said that it also expected a surge in South American asylum seekers from countries like Colombia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Peru, and Venezuela.

Last year, the European Asylum Support Office revealed that there had been a surge of new asylum seekers from the South American region, with a 4,000 per cent increase over the last decade.
Spain has been by far the most popular choice for most South American asylum seekers, largely due to the common language, but other nations such as Belgium have also begun to recognise more and more asylum seekers from Latin America.
Sweden has also seen a rise in family reunification or chain migration over the last year, with Iraqis and Syrians making up the largest numbers.

Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,” which spurred a flurry of inquiries and led to confusion within the government, the National Post reports.

In emails obtained by the National Post, an official from the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada agency warned colleagues to expect a flood of new requests and inquiries for asylum.
One reply from Canada’s embassy in Mexico asked: “Guidance required on how to respond to increasing number of refugee enquiries in the region following change in US administration and Prime Minister’s tweet.”

An official at the embassy also wrote: “I am seeking official guidance/response from Ottawa on how to address refugee enquiries following all the publicity around the US ban on some nationalities, and our Prime Minister’s tweet on welcoming refugees.”

“We are receiving an increasing number of enquiries from the public about requesting refugee status in Canada, and a number clearly having links with our Prime Minister’s tweet this weekend.
“A significant number of the enquiries received since the weekend have been from nationals of the ‘US banned countries’, but we are also receiving them from all nationalities, both through emails and directly at our reception,” they added.
Since the tweet, the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border, particularly Haitians into the French-speaking province of Quebec, has exploded. The influx has seen tens of thousands of illegals cross the border, including some caught possessing child pornography.
As a result of the number of illegal migrants seeking asylum, the city of Montreal was forced to convert part of the Olympic stadium into a shelter for asylum seekers.
The mass migration into Quebec has shown little signs of stopping as Quebec broadcaster Le Canal Nouvelles reported this week that at least 500 asylum seekers came across the border with the United States over Easter weekend alone.

The province has so far been forced to spend a million dollars to set up emergency shelters since last Autumn to handle the numbers of migrants before they can be sent to an asylum centre in Montreal.

High Commissioner for Refugees say they hope to see a regional agreement on that status Thursday when migration and interior department representatives from the U.S., Mexico, and Central America meet in Nicaragua. The group will discuss updating a 30-year-old declaration regarding the obligations nations have to aid refugees.


While such a resolution would lack any legal weight in the United States, the agency said it believes “the U.S. and Mexico should recognize that this is a refugee situation, which implies that they shouldn’t be automatically sent to their home countries but rather receive international protection.”
Most of the people widely considered to be refugees by the international community are fleeing more traditional political or ethnic conflicts like those in Syria or the Sudan. Central Americans would be among the first modern migrants considered refugees because they are fleeing violence and extortion at the hands of criminal gangs.
“They are leaving for some reason. Let’s not send them back in a mechanical way, but rather evaluate the reasons they left their country,” Fernando Protti, regional representative for the U.N. refugee agency, told The Associated Press.

The United States has seen a dramatic increase in the number of Central American migrants crossing into its territory, particularly children traveling without any adult guardian. More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended since October. Three-fourths of them are from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and most say they are fleeing pervasive gang violence and crushing poverty.
Both Congressional Republicans and the Obama administration have called for action to reverse the trend. Among other changes, the administration wants to end a 2008 law allowing child migrants to automatically appear before an immigration judge. Instead, Border Patrol agents could decide whether to deport them or allow them an additional hearing.
Asked Monday whether the Obama administration viewed the situation at the border as a refugee crisis, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was “a humanitarian situation that requires urgent attention.”
The administration, he said, wanted to ensure child migrants were housed in “humane conditions” while authorities worked quickly to determine whether they should be allowed to remain in the U.S. If not, he said, the Homeland Security secretary should be allowed “to exercise his discretion about repatriating.”
Many Congressional Republicans attribute the increased immigration to a failure to secure the border and recent immigration policy changes that led many to believe child migrants would be allowed to stay.

Many of the migrants, in fact, stay for years as their cases wend through overloaded migration courts. Those who say they are fleeing criminal violence generally are not eligible for political asylum, which is reserved for groups persecuted for their beliefs or identities. U.N. officials say there is no way of forcing the U.S. and Mexico to accept Central Americans as refugees, but a broad-based change in terminology could bring pressure on the two countries to do more.
“Unaccompanied children and families who fear for their lives and freedoms must not be forcibly returned without access to proper asylum procedures,” UNHCR official Leslie Velez said in testimony submitted to the House Judiciary Committee late last month.

Immigration experts in the U.S. and Central America say the flow of migrants from Honduras and El Salvador is likely to rise as the two countries experience gang-related violence. Honduras, a primary transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine, has the world’s highest homicide rate for a nation that is not at war. In El Salvador, the end of a truce between street gangs has led to a steep rise in homicides this year.
Violence by criminal organizations spread in recent decades after members of California street gangs were deported to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, where they overwhelmed weak and corrupt police forces and seized control of large sections of the countries.
Salvadorans heading north through Mexico who were interviewed by The Associated Press last month said there also was fear of the “Sombra Negra,” or “Black Shadow” — groups of masked men in civilian clothes who are believed responsible for extrajudicial killings of teens in gang-controlled neighborhoods. The Salvadoran government denies any involvement in death squads, but says it is investigating the reports.

In El Salvador, at least 135,000 people, or 2.1 percent of the population, have been forced to leave their homes, the vast majority due to gang extortion and violence, according to U.N. figures. That’s more than twice the percentage displaced by Colombia’s brutal civil war, the U.N. says.
Hondurans have been terrorized by a recent wave of attacks against churches, schools and buses.
During a recent visit to the U.S., Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said migrants from his country were “displaced by war” and called on the United States to acknowledge that.

The new 49 per cent figure covers the 482 unaccompanied asylum seekers who came to Hamburg from January to September of this year, Die Welt reports.


Across Germany this year there have been a total of 55,890 asylum seekers claiming to be under the age of 18 but according to the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, 24,116, or 43 percent, were officially adults.

The assessments of adulthood are made by the Child and Youth Emergency Service (KJND), who examine asylum seekers without passports or other identification and send suspected cases to Eppendorf University Hospital to be examined. The hospital then conducts a number of tests including x-rays and tomography to determine the approximate age of the asylum seeker.
Underage migrants are taken into care by the youth welfare service, and if they are determined to be adults they are made to register with the regular asylum authorities.

Many asylum seekers have claimed to be underage because it is much harder for the German government to deport underage asylum seekers and many get preferential treatment.
According to Afghan asylum seeker Hussein K., the suspected murderer of German student Maria Ladenburger, he lied about his age to receive better benefits saying, “if you’re a minor, the situation in Germany is better.”
Germany is not the only country facing a large number of asylum seekers lying about their age. In Austria last year, authorities found almost 1,000 asylum seekers had lied about being under eighteen. An Austrian policeman commented on the issue at the time, saying: “It is absurd for us to see grown men with beards and greying hair that claim to be 17 years of age.”

Officials in Canada are scrambling to accommodate hundreds of migrants fleeing from the United States in fear of being deported back to their home countries by the Trump administration. 500 migrants arrived on Tuesday, and another 300 people arrived on Wednesday. The average has grown to 150 people per day requesting asylum in Canada.
Some 4,345 migrants arrived in the first six months of 2017, and another 1,000 arrived in July alone. Migrants that cross at official land border crossing are denied asylum on the spot and are sent back to the United States, under an agreement between the two countries. The “Safe Third Country Agreement” was signed on December 5, 2002, as part of a plan to improve security between the two countries in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.
However, the agreement applies only to official land border crossings. For that reason, most migrants simply cross the border at an unmanned location. By entering Canada illegally, they bypass this agreement. They can then claim refugee status, seek asylum, and then stay while their refugee applications are being processed. Hundreds of migrants have crossed into Canada by walking along a dirt crossing into the Quebec town of Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle.

Canadian authorities were unprepared for the sudden surge in migrants. To accommodate them, Montreal’s Olympic Stadium, built for the 1976 summer Olympics, has been transformed into a makeshift refugee center. Others are being sent to schools, which are not in session during the summer. Other accommodations will have to be found when schools open in September.
Some 70 percent of the migrants are from Haiti, but others are from Sudan, Turkey, and Eritrea. There are also some who are US citizens fleeing to Canada.
Most of the asylum seekers are from Haiti, who arrived in the United States following the January 2010 earthquake. The Department of Homeland Security under President Obama granted Haiti the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) benefit following the earthquake, which permits them to stay in the country and work, and send remittances back to their families in Haiti.
Besides Haiti, several Latin American countries have TPS status. El Salvador has had TPS status since 2001 because of a devastating earthquake. Nicaragua and Honduras have had TPS status since a hurricane that happened 18 years ago.
The TPS for Haiti was meant to last only 18 months, but it kept getting 18-month extensions under the Obama administration. When the last TPS extension expired in May, the DHS announced a final six-month extension. In a statement from DHS:

The Department of Homeland Security urges Haitian TPS recipients who do not have another immigration status to use the time before Jan. 22, 2018, to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States.
So many Haitian refugees have been taking the DHS advice and arranging their departure from the United States by traveling to Canada. They were encouraged by a welcoming tweet from Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau on January 28, shortly after Trump announced his travel ban:
To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada
Trudeau’s tweet was followed by a picture of him greeting a refugee family. The two tweets received over a million likes and half-a-million retweets. Canadian Broadcasting and Canadian TV News and AFP

Haiti appears to be a cursed country. Before 2010 it was already almost the poorest country in the world, with many neighborhoods strewn knee high in garbage. Then, on January 12, 2010, the earthquake struck, killing 316,000 people and leaving more than 1.5 million people homeless, and 3.3 million facing food shortages.

Then, the United Nations sent in peacekeepers to aid in the cleanup. The peacekeepers didn’t accomplish too much cleanup, but they did infect the water in Haiti with cholera, in a country which had previously been free of cholera. This caused hundreds of thousands of cases of cholera. It was later attributed to the peacekeepers from Nepal.
Billions of dollars in aid have been spent in Haiti since then, apparently accomplishing little because of pervasive corruption. The Red Cross, for example, is accused of building only six homes in Haiti with nearly half a billion dollars in donated funds and spending millions on internal expenses.
Haitian migrants have been flooding into other countries, usually in order to work and send remittances back to their families. The Dominican Republic recently granted a one-year extension to some 230,000 Haitian migrants trying to renew or obtain residency permits. Other countries, including the Bahamas and Turks-and-Caicos have also had to cope with Haitian migrants. Huffington Post (12-Jan-2017) and Reuters and NPR and Magnetic Media TV and Bahama Journal

Ribbenvik stated that the current regulations in Sweden that cover asylum seeker cases are simply unreasonable and allow for potential terrorists and others to remain in Sweden even if they have been rejected for asylum claims.


“Should potential terrorists and war criminals who should be expelled be allowed to stay in Sweden on the same terms as the people who have been given protection here? The answer to that question should be a clear no,” Ribbenvik said.
“But today we have a regulatory framework which means that in many cases they can stay in Sweden on roughly the same conditions as others and, in addition, move freely in and out of the country,” he added, in comments reported by Expressen.


The Migration Board head went on to add that the board has repeatedly referred suspected threats among asylum seekers to the Swedish Security police (Sapo) but has been told on multiple occasions that the individuals do not pose enough of a threat to have their application rejected.
“Despite the deportation decisions that the Migration Board makes in these cases, people often remain in the country. This is because, as a rule, decisions cannot be enforced because no one may be deported to a country where he or she risks the death penalty, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment,” he said.
Several war criminals have been discovered among the migrant population in recent years, with a Syrian asylum seeker charged in 2017 for posing in front of dead and wounded members of Islamic State.
A year later, the Migration Board announced that the number of suspected war criminal cases had increased with 52 cases reported in 2017, double the number from two years before.

They are now demanding to go to Sweden or Finland as the terms of asylum there are more favourable.In a report by Denmark’s TV2 News, migrants told a local journalist that they do not want to stay in Denmark, but are choosing instead to head to Sweden to register for asylum.


Speaking conversational English, one migrant told the reporter “We want Sweden.” When she puts it to him that Sweden is 500km (310miles), he smiles and replies: “No problem. We walked from Syria to here [with] no problem.”
Marwen el Mohammed, another asylum seeker in Denmark told the reporter that there were two reasons the men did not want to seek asylum in Denmark, a peaceful country. “The first one: the salary for refugees decreased about 50 per cent from 10,000 kroner to about 5,000,” he said.
The second is that Finland and other neighbouring countries allow the migrants to bring their families to join them within two to three months, whereas Denmark makes them wait for a year and a half before they bring their families over. “This is a long time to have left our family behind,” he said.

In the face of hundreds of thousands of migrants entering Europe to claim asylum, the Danish government last week tightened immigration rules.
According to the Danish immigration authorities, the Danish Parliament agreed to slash social benefits for newly arrived refugees by 50 per cent; foreign nationals will not be able to bring family to Denmark for a year; and foreign nationals must wait at least five years for a permanent residence permit. In addition, only those who can speak and understand Danish will be granted a permit.
The rules around deportation of failed asylum seekers have also been altered to ensure that they leave the country, via a new “special return centre” to ensure that rejected asylum seekers leave Denmark as quickly as possible.
This is not the first time Denmark has tightened immigration laws. The country saw the number of people applying for asylum plunge early this year after it brought in new laws which introduced a temporary, one year residence permit for those fleeing wars such as the one in Syria.
Consequently, just 626 people, half of whom were from Syria, applied for asylum in Denmark in January, down from 3,150 in September 2014, according to The Local.
Meanwhile Sweden, who in 2013 became the first European country to grant automatic residency to Syrian refugees, has seen record numbers of asylum requests.
